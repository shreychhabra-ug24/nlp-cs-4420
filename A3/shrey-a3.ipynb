    "\n",
    "## Entity Recognition Accuracy (BioNER)\n",
    "The BioNER model performs reasonably well in identifying drug and symptom entities, but some limitations are a bit apparent, such as missed entities in longer and more complex sentences (probably due to token missclassification). Subword issues might also be a cause. While the token merging does help to address some fragmented outputs, but some edge cases might end up splitting entities incorrectly. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Cause-Effect Detection Reliability (BART)\n",
    "The general cause-effect summaries produced by BART were fine, but the summarization occasionally ommitted key terms, particularly in longer text inputs. Matching extracted entities with summary text was case insensitive and keyword based, and though this effective, it also quite simple and not necessarily the most accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Causality Filtering - therapeutic vs adverse\n",
    "For adverse effects, I did not use any filtering beyond BART summaries, under the assumption that the data was pre-labeled as adverse (POS). I added simple keyword rules which improved the precision but might have missed legitimate therapeutic relationships described in other words (like improved, bettered), and inlcuded false positives where keywords appeared but were not clearly linked causally. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the frequency counts are dependent on both NER success and summarization matching, so each pairs count is only as good as the above pipelines."
