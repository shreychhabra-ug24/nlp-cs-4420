suggest that weight loss induced by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs can also cause a decline in muscle mass and bone mineral density, similar to that observed in aging. A new study published in the Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia, and Muscle suggests that the antibody bimagrumab is effective in increasing muscle mass and bone density in a mouse model of muscle and bone loss. These findings suggest that bimagrumab could potentially help preserve not only muscle mass, as shown by previous research, but also help prevent bone loss in individuals using GLP-1 drugs for weight loss. The study’s author, Frederik Duch Bromer, a researcher at Aarhus University, Denmark, said, “Since the rise of incretin therapies like Wegovy and Mounjaro, scientists have been searching for ways to counteract the loss of muscle and bone mass often accompanying rapid weight loss. Our research shows that bimagrumab can mitigate even more severe muscle and bone loss than what typically occurs with weight loss therapies.” “As bimagrumab is now being repurposed to help preserve lean mass during weight loss, its ability to protect bone as well is especially relevant given the large number of people using these treatments,” Bromer told Medical News Today. A loss of muscle mass and a decline in bone density are common features of aging that often occur together. The loss of muscle mass and strength with aging is referred to as sarcopenia, whereas the decrease in bone mass and bone mineral density is referred to as osteoporosis. Besides old age, limited physical activity can also lead to muscle loss and osteoporosis. While medications are available for the treatment of osteoporosis, there is a lack of approved treatments for muscle loss. One of the categories of drugs currently under investigation for the treatment of muscle loss includes drugs that inhibit the activation of the activin receptor or the signaling pathway activated by this receptor. Inhibition of the activin signaling pathway leads to increased muscle mass and bone formation and enhanced blood cell formation. The antibody bimagrumab is an example of one such drug that binds to the activin receptors to inhibit the activation of the activin signaling pathway. Similar to other inhibitors of the activin signaling pathway, animal and clinical studies have shown that bimagrumab can increase muscle mass and lean body mass. The use of GLP-1 receptor agonists is associated with muscle mass loss and a decline in bone density. Currently, bimagrumab is being investigated in a clinical trial to evaluate its ability to prevent muscle loss in individuals using Wegovy, a type of GLP-1 drug. Bones and muscles not only cooperate with each other during movements, but muscles also release small proteins called myokines that impact bone health. However, it is not known whether bimagrumab can also simultaneously improve bone health along with increasing muscle mass. In the present study, researchers examined whether bimagrumab could improve bone health and increase muscle mass simultaneously. The inhibitors of the activin signaling pathway can also lead to an increase in blood cell production and potentially increase the risk of blood clots. Hence, it is essential to assess the risk of blood clots due to bimagrumab before it can be considered for preventing muscle and bone loss. In the present study, the researchers assessed the impact of bimagrumab on muscle and bone mass in healthy and immobilized mice, with the latter serving as a model of bone and muscle loss. To simulate the simultaneous loss of muscle mass and bone density, the researchers injected a group of mice with botulinum toxin into the quadriceps and the gastrocnemius, the major muscles of the hindlimb. The botulinum toxin causes paralysis of the hindlimb muscles, resulting in immobilization of the animal, followed by muscle mass loss and a decline in bone density. The healthy and immobilized mice in the bimagrumab group received two weekly antibody injections over 21 days, whereas those in the control groups received an injection of the vehicle. After 21 days, the mice in all groups were euthanized, and the muscles and bones in the right hindlimb were removed and evaluated. The researchers found that bimagrumab increased muscle mass, the size of muscle fibers, and bone mineral density in the hindlimb of both free-moving and immobilized mice. Bimagrumab also promoted new bone formation, including at the end of the thigh bone or femur, which is prone to fracture in older individuals. The scientists observed that the increase in muscle mass and bone mineral density was smaller in the immobilized mice, likely due to the potent action of botulinum toxin. Yet, these results demonstrate that bimagrumab could potentially help increase muscle mass and bone density in individuals at risk of sarcopenia and osteoporosis. The researchers also examined the impact of bimagrumab on blood cell formation at two and seven days after the injection of the antibody. Bimagrumab did not have an impact on blood cell formation or any other related factors, suggesting its safety for preserving muscle and bone mass in patients using GLP-1 drugs. However, more research and larger clinical trials will be needed to determine its effectiveness and safety. “While our study focused on a model of muscle and bone loss, it did not specifically examine bone loss related to obesity. Since weight loss drugs are mainly used by people with obesity, it is essential to explore how bimagrumab interacts with bone affected by obesity,” Bromer added."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-02-22T19:26:49.746149Z","updated_at":"2025-02-22T19:42:34.931518Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2,"annotations":[{"id":2,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":31,"end":44,"text":" Donald Trump","labels":["PERSON"]},"id":"ruRcWIEDpj","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":19,"end":22,"text":"US ","labels":["GPE"]},"id":"pOjg4AbFsW","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":91,"end":100,"text":"Greenland","labels":["GPE"]},"id":"GhQQn2a-KE","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":117,"end":124,"text":"Danish ","labels":["NORP"]},"id":"zXSrgmkPzd","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":199,"end":208,"text":"Americans","labels":["NORP"]},"id":"8TBET2FSuL","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":243,"end":250,"text":"Denmark","labels":["GPE"]},"id":"Pesk6EFJ4m","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":293,"end":301,"text":"New York","labels":["GPE"]},"id":"WJ9S-FXAD8","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":429,"end":437,"text":"Ozempic ","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"ctTcNhnw8f","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":457,"end":462,"text":"Lego ","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"4u5cmbAJ5Q","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":479,"end":485,"text":"Trump ","labels":["PERSON"]},"id":"7hgQDH_BqM","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":493,"end":496,"text":"US ","labels":["GPE"]},"id":"dWN4M1PLkv","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":826,"end":843,"text":"Mette Frederiksen","labels":["PERSON"]},"id":"GxF6FYw1k5","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1089,"end":1094,"text":"NATO ","labels":["GPE"]},"id":"GVTqaQZwBE","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1215,"end":1223,"text":"Ozempic ","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"P8kJXlMddR","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1227,"end":1233,"text":"Wegovy","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"A1STyqSLH8","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1263,"end":1275,"text":"Novo Nordisk","labels":["ORG"]},"id":"4-hdmb-ogv","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1417,"end":1421,"text":"CDC ","labels":["ORG"]},"id":"sjO000rpWF","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1524,"end":1567,"text":"Journal of the American Medical Association","labels":["ORG"]},"id":"vGH_Leecvl","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2060,"end":2078,"text":"Trading Economics ","labels":["ORG"]},"id":"cp3J-2Iif1","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2687,"end":2696,"text":"Abhishek ","labels":["PERSON"]},"id":"TEN_OiZXVQ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2506,"end":2518,"text":"hearing aids","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"GQIdiavAA5","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-02-22T19:49:15.609992Z","updated_at":"2025-02-22T19:49:15.609992Z","draft_created_at":"2025-02-22T19:45:53.308179Z","lead_time":222.354,"prediction":{},"result_count":21,"unique_id":"a94951a4-f884-467a-95e7-e6cc90769839","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"ad32022d-articles_for_label_studio.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Listen to Story If US President Donald Trump is indeed serious about his threat to acquire Greenland, the autonomous Danish territory, it may well affect the weight-loss journey of millions of obese Americans. Puzzled? The equation is simple. Denmark, despite having a population smaller than New York, has several trump cards up its sleeve, with the foremost being curbing or halting the exports of the popular weight-loss drug Ozempic and kids' favourite Lego toys. Ever since Trump won the US presidential election, the Republican has on several occasions floated the idea of buying Greenland. He has only escalated the pitch after taking over as US President last month, threatening punitive tariffs and even hinting at military action to take control of the strategically important island. However, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, in a fiery phone call with Trump, made it clear that Greenland was \"not for sale\", the BBC reported. DENMARK TARIFF THREAT MAY HURT WAISTLINES OF AMERICANS The issue has threatened the possibility of an all-out trade war between the US and its NATO ally. However, it may turn out to be a pain in the waistlines of millions of Americans. In the past two years, the drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, made by Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk, have revolutionised obesity and diabetes treatment in the United States - which has one of the highest obesity rates in the world. In fact, CDC data shows that in 23 American states, more than one in three adults (35%) has obesity. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has revealed that between 2021 and 2023, the number of Ozempic prescriptions in the US has jumped by 400 per cent. In the backdrop of this, if Trump does go on with steep tariffs on Denmark, it could jack up the prices of Ozempic and Wegovy. Presently, Americans have to shell out nearly $1,000 for each packet of Ozempic (without discounts or insurance). For Wegovy, it is $1,300 per package. The price of the drugs is already higher in the US than in other countries. Additionally, data by Trading Economics shows that the US imported medicines, vaccines and antibiotics worth $5.7 billion from \"pharma state\" Denmark in 2023. Even if the US wants to make such drugs from scratch, it doesn't have the resources as the active ingredient for Ozempic and Wegovy, called semaglutide, is made in Denmark. The widely popular Lego Group, the world's largest toymaker, is also based in Denmark. Besides, Denmark is also the leading supplier of hearing aids to America. Thus, even if Trump decides to go on with his tariff threats, there is no shortage of economic leverage for Denmark to hurt the United States.Published By: Abhishek DePublished On: Feb 1, 2025Must Watch"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-02-22T19:26:49.746149Z","updated_at":"2025-02-22T19:49:15.670375Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":5,"annotations":[{"id":3,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":4,"end":16,"text":"Semaglutide ","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"Ms3PrDZBTf","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":123,"end":130,"text":"Ozempic","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"4XVSn4vDRr","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":132,"end":138,"text":"Wegovy","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"hgn8mJ2Kib","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":77,"end":81,"text":"FDA ","labels":["ORG"]},"id":"N-R-sp4367","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":320,"end":325,"text":"March","labels":["TIME"]},"id":"gzWB1V1CUM","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":339,"end":346,"text":"August ","labels":["TIME"]},"id":"jsylNsRjF8","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":725,"end":737,"text":"Novo Nordisk","labels":["ORG"]},"id":"RQRGZNlBGN","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":970,"end":980,"text":"Dave Moore","labels":["PERSON"]},"id":"M7oo8x6yZG","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1010,"end":1013,"text":"US ","labels":["GPE"]},"id":"3zqq5sED3A","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1537,"end":1549,"text":"Novo Nordisk","labels":["ORG"]},"id":"gI6M6gp4By","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1445,"end":1449,"text":"CDC ","labels":["ORG"]},"id":"aRaUFWMxeJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2147,"end":2156,"text":"pharmacy ","labels":["LOC"]},"id":"3-2WH55cXA","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2928,"end":2939,"text":"dulaglutide","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"P9a-GAVpcP","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2951,"end":2960,"text":"Trulicity","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"gDt_XdRd2I","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2966,"end":2978,"text":"liraglutide ","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"03H0OBzPOP","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2979,"end":2986,"text":"Victoza","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"V-OVeghj_q","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2988,"end":2995,"text":"Saxenda","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"I2lxBrTpyO","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":3108,"end":3146,"text":" Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis Ctexli","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"arqN5tyA40","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":3314,"end":3324,"text":"Sarah Gray","labels":["PERSON"]},"id":"YAgEB8HnLt","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":5342,"end":5354,"text":"Cranbury, NJ","labels":["GPE"]},"id":"DYA_ACyiFe","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-02-22T19:53:05.002347Z","updated_at":"2025-02-22T19:53:05.002347Z","draft_created_at":"2025-02-22T19:49:59.258542Z","lead_time":201.272,"prediction":{},"result_count":20,"unique_id":"d9ddfc0a-6677-47d0-916b-1e355abf3b90","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":5,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"ad32022d-articles_for_label_studio.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"    Semaglutide has been in shortage since 2022 due to increased demand.

In a statement, the FDA said it confirmed Novo Nordisk's \"stated product availability and manufacturing capacity\" of these prescription drugs meets or exceeds current and projected demand. The agency warned consumers and doctors might still experience \"limited localized supply disruptions\" as the products are shipped from drug factories to distributors to pharmacies. The Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk said it has invested $6.5 billion this year in the United States to bolster drug production facilities that are operating 24\/7, shipping Wegovy and Ozempic to wholesalers. Pharmaceutical giants that market lucrative weight-loss drugs have battled with firms that sell less expensive versions made by compounding pharmacies. The FDA allows compounding pharmacies to sell copies of drugs when the medications are in short supply. But compounding pharmacies face stiffer restrictions when a drug shortage is resolved. Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle. Companies that market compounded drugs − combining, mixing or altering drug ingredients − have prospered amid shortages of the class of weight-loss medications, called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists. Hims & Hers, which launched a Super Bowl ad touting its weight loss product offerings, markets a compounded version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. Shares of Hims & Hers plunged 17% in mid-morning trading after the FDA's announcement. The FDA said it won't take enforcement action against pharmacies or doctors that make compounded semaglutide due to the shortage before April 22. Facilities that compound, distribute or dispense semaglutide injections won't face enforcement action before May 22. In December, the FDA declared that Eli Lilly's weight loss and diabetes medication tirzepatide, sold under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound, was no longer in short supply. That meant pharmacies had to discontinue \"compounding, distributing or dispensing\" tirzepatide as of Feb 18. Suppliers that produce batches of the drug and sell to others have until March 19 to cease distribution. Compounding pharmacies are regulated by state boards of pharmacy and source ingredients are usually obtained from factories registered with the FDA. However, the federal agency doesn't verify the safety or effectiveness of compounding pharmacies."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-02-22T19:26:49.746149Z","updated_at":"2025-02-22T19:56:56.267173Z","inner_id":7,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":8,"annotations":[{"id":6,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":22,"end":35,"text":"Alexander Tin","labels":["PERSON"]},"id":"tVOghHkfzp","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":45,"end":86,"text":" Nicole Brown Chau ","labels":["PERSON"]},"id":"pLyukRRH1p","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":131,"end":139,"text":"CBS News","labels":["ORG"]},"id":"Y_ZlMuh7x3","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":140,"end":172,"text":"The Food and Drug Administration","labels":["ORG"]},"id":"eyLPa0bFML","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":183,"end":190,"text":"Friday ","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"MkfQLvEpPz","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":254,"end":262,"text":"Ozempic ","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"P7RZdXv6Cj","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":266,"end":272,"text":"Wegovy","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"WospYWcKN8","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":440,"end":443,"text":"FDA","labels":["ORG"]},"id":"sq24hKAS4l","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":488,"end":500,"text":"Novo Nordisk","labels":["ORG"]},"id":"F5l1bxu9zR","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":541,"end":553,"text":"semaglutide ","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"Mz1FUTUK4N","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":757,"end":763,"text":" U.S. ","labels":["GPE"]},"id":"-9sCTRrQ4x","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1211,"end":1219,"text":"April 22","labels":["TIME"]},"id":"C-SIm7i2j2","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1468,"end":1479,"text":"tirzepatide","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"-ULu4CSMRm","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1426,"end":1435,"text":"Eli Lilly","labels":["ORG"]},"id":"pxcTmjli8V","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2066,"end":2074,"text":"Mounjaro","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"CGGxuLrrLF","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2076,"end":2084,"text":"Zepbound","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"OeL64aPhkS","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2107,"end":2110,"text":"GLP","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"pMs49Dm_ZC","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2303,"end":2306,"text":"CBS","labels":["ORG"]},"id":"PhDTr5mSDo","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-02-22T19:59:22.078828Z","updated_at":"2025-02-22T19:59:22.078828Z","draft_created_at":"2025-02-22T19:57:12.694088Z","lead_time":141.799,"prediction":{},"result_count":18,"unique_id":"29232a70-f7ed-4342-a81c-eaa9950236cd","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":8,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"ad32022d-articles_for_label_studio.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"                      Alexander Tin Edited By                       Nicole Brown Chau February 21, 2025 \/ 11:42 AM EST           \/ CBS News The Food and Drug Administration announced Friday it had officially declared an end to the nationwide shortage of Ozempic and Wegovy, medications used for diabetes and weight loss. The agency first declared a shortage of semaglutide, the main ingredient used to make Ozempic and Wegovy, in 2022. The FDA's announcement comes months after drugmaker Novo Nordisk told the agency that all dosages of its semaglutide product had become fully available nationwide. The company said in a statement that it confirms the supply of the medications, which are prescription-only, \"now meets or exceeds both current and projected U.S. demand.\" \"This update comes after ongoing dialogue with the FDA, and substantial efforts by Novo Nordisk to increase manufacturing capacity, including $6.5 billion dollars of investments in the U.S. this year alone,\" the drugmaker said. The FDA said that it will allow compounding pharmacies to continue to make copies of semaglutide for now, which they are usually allowed to do only while the drug is in shortage. That leeway will continue until April 22 for many pharmacies and May 22 for outsourcing facilities to \"avoid unnecessary disruption\" to patients, the agency said. This is similar to what the FDA has granted compounding pharmacies making copies of Eli Lilly's diabetes and weight loss drug tirzepatide, amid an ongoing lawsuit brought by outsourcing facilities disputing the FDA's decision to declare the shortage of that weight loss drug over. Some compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities have made millions making copies of semaglutide and tirzepatide during their shortages in recent years, amid a flurry of companies cashing in on demand for the drugs. The FDA is also facing calls to do more to crack down on counterfeits of the drugs, including from state attorneys general who urged the agency this week to stop illegal imports from overseas. \"Demand for the medications Mounjaro, Zepbound, Ozempic, and Wegovy (GLP-1 drugs) has skyrocketed, but supply shortages and high costs have created opportunities for wrongdoers to cash in and endanger consumers,\" they wrote.

According to a health ministry study quoted in the report, in Brazil’s largest cities, obesity increased to 24 percent in 2023 from nearly 12 percent in 2006. An NYT analysis of the São Paulo State database showed that theft of Ozempic has risen in the last three years—from one incident in 2022 when four boxes of Ozempic were taken from a single drugstore to 18 in 2023 and 39 in 2024. “The wave of thefts began when social media started openly discussing the drug, particularly as celebrity and influencers showcased dramatic weight loss,” Renata Goncalves, head of a union of pharmacists in Sao Paulo, told the NYT.

But the drugs are not cheap and are seen as a luxury item. In India, people are spending as much as Rs 80,000 on a six-month course or scouring the black market for a shot. There are fears that this trend will continue to rise. The patent for semaglutide, the main ingredient of the Ozempic drug, will expire in 2026 in a number of countries, including India, China and Brazil. Only then will manufacturers in these countries be able to market generic and cheaper versions of the drug.

It lowers blood sugar levels in people with diabetes and also reduces heart disease risk in people with diabetes. In addition to its glucose-lowering effect, Ozempic has been associated with reduced appetite and weight loss. It has recently gained popularity and people across the world are using it for quick weight loss. However, it is not the safest and healthiest way to lose weight. Overuse of Ozempic is linked with several side effects. Recently, in an Instagram video, singer Avery revealed that she had been diagnosed with osteoporosis after taking Ozempic for a year for weight loss. In her video, she urged her Instagram followers not to \"make the same mistake.\" A healthy diet with regular exercise can help with sustainable weight loss. However, the use of Ozempic may contribute to sudden weight loss which can cause a decrease in muscle mass, low bone density and poor metabolic rate. Some studies also suggest that overuse of this drug can make your bones brittle and increase the risk of fractures. \"There is very little direct evidence that suggests the link between Ozempic use and osteoporosis. Significant weight loss, however, does have an impact on bone density that could increase the risk of osteoporosis in the elderly. It is important to monitor bone health in any treatment of weight loss,\" says Dr. Vineet Kumar Surana, Consultant - Diabetes and Endocrinology at Manipal Hospital. \"For those who are planning to take or have already taken Ozempic, they should monitor their bone health,\" urged Dr. Kumar. He has further recommended the following tips for optimal bone health: As we already know, Ozempic contains an ingredient called semaglutide which is prescribed primarily for managing type-2 diabetes. It helps in regulating blood sugar levels and can lead to weight reduction. Semaglutide mimics the GLP-1 hormone which ultimately increases a feeling of fullness, and reduces appetite, leading to decreased calorie intake and weight loss.

While the US patent for the Semaglutide expires in FY31, the India patent expires next year, and the company is geared for an India launch.        “If we get all regulatory clearances on time for Semaglutide, we will be able to launch it 1HFY26,\" a Natco spokesperson told Mint in an emailed response.        Dr. Reddy’s is eyeing a Canada launch in January 2026. “I believe we are positioned well to get approval for that period of time,\" Dr. Reddy’s CEO Erez Israeli said in an earnings call in January. “Normally, between the time that you submit the product to the Canadian authorities, until you get approval, is 12 to 14 months…So what you're going to see is probably the sequence in which people will get approval, and we hope to be the first one in the pack,\" he added.        But that’s not all. The pharma major is also looking at India and Brazil as well as other emerging markets where the product is in demand.        “At present, we at JM Financial Institutional Research see Dr. Reddy’s as one of first few generic filers for semaglutide globally,\" Chalke said.  Is it enough? JM Financials estimates that Dr. Reddy’s could clock $100-150 million in Semaglutide sales if they launch in 3-4 markets next year.        On the other hand, the brokerage is anticipating $700 million from Revlimid sales in the US for the company in the coming year, before loss of exclusivity.        Dr. Reddy’s has some other products and strategies in place to offset the drop in Revlimid sales. The company is looking at the launch of biosimilar Abatacept in the US by the end of FY27. ““Abatacept is a $3-4 billion product in the US, if Dr. Reddy’s is the only company to launch that product for at least one year, their sales could be upward of $100 million for that product,\" Chalke said.        Together, Semaglutide and Abatacept may be able to substantially offset the Revlimid loss, the analyst said.        The company also has the recently-acquired nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) portfolio from Haleon plc in Europe, as an additional growth driver.        Natco Pharma has some other key first-to-file products in the pipeline, including Risdiplam Oral Solution for spinal muscular atrophy and breast cancer drug Olaparib, although the timelines for these are yet to be defined.        Analysts are divided on the company’s prospects, though.        “There are products in the pipeline, but there will be a one or two-year gap in between, where the base will be much lower, the profits will be much lower,\" an analyst who requested anonymity told Mint.        In a research note dated 14 February, ICICI Direct analysts said: “We continue to have faith in Natco’s ability to focus on blockbusters which are capable of generating robust cash flows for 3-5 years' horizon before they fade.\" On the other hand, Nuvama analysts said that while the next couple of quarters could witness robust growth due to Revlimid, this is not sustainable in the future.        “We also note an impressive US launch pipeline, but uncertainty persists around launch and approval timelines. Break-even in the agrochem business in FY26 and the GLP-1 opportunity in India are triggers that can help Natco offset part of the gRevlimid hit in FY27 and beyond,\" the Nuvama analysts said in a note dated 13 February.        Natco believes there will be a drop in earnings in FY27. “That's the elephant in the room, [we] have to accept that earnings will drop in ‘27 March,\" Nannapaneni told investors in an earnings call last week.       There is no dearth of competition when it comes to Semaglutide, with leading generics makers jumping in. Sun Pharma has already undertaken clinical trials for Semaglutide, while Biocon signed an exclusive licensing and supply agreement for Semaglutide commercialization in Brazil with Biomm last year.        Domestically, innovators Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have also indicated potential launches. While Novo Nordisk hasn’t clarified a timeline, Eli Lilly has announced that it will launch its weight loss drug Tirzepatide in India in 2025 at competitive pricing. Indian pharma companies like Dr. Reddy’s, Natco, Cipla, Sun Pharma, Zydus and Aurobindo Pharma have cashed in on generic versions of the $8 billion blockbuster drug distributed in restricted quantities in the US since March 2022, per agreements with innovator Celgene’s parent company Bristol Myers Squibb.

Recently, a new study found evidence that Ozempic may be a promising medicine for individuals with alcohol use disorders. This investigation, one of the first clinical trials focused on a population with alcohol use disorders, expands other research exploring the impact of GLP-1 agonists on alcohol and tobacco use among individuals with obesity or diabetes who were being treated with these medications. GLP-1 (also known as glucagon-like peptide 1) is a hormone that is produced by the digestive system and in parts of the brain after we eat. GLP-1 agonist medicines such as Ozempic and Wegovy mimic this hormone’s effects, letting the body know that you’ve eaten enough. The powerful weight loss effects of these medicines have led individuals who take them to achieve a 15 percent reduction in their body weight, on average. Addiction scientists took an interest in GLP-1 agonists after some people who were taking them for weight loss noted that in addition to suppressing their appetite, the medication also seemed to reduce their desire to drink alcohol and\/or smoke. Though the reasons these medicines had this effect are not yet well understood, we can make some assumptions based on the way they work on appetite. We know that GLP-1 reduces dopamine (the brain’s pleasure chemical). When a person has food in front of them that they normally really like, such as a piece of cake, without the usual amount of dopamine released, they won’t feel as “excited” in anticipation of enjoying the cake. Without a strong urge, desire, or craving for the cake, they become less likely to want it. If the same process is happening in relation to alcohol and drugs, then GLP-1 agonists may reduce the desire to use them. Research is currently in the early stages. So far, we’ve learned from preliminary study results that those with obesity or diabetes who take GLP-1 agonist medications show reductions in alcohol and tobacco consumption. To date, there have been two randomized clinical trials (this is the “gold standard” type of research study for testing the effectiveness of a drug) evaluating a GLP-1 agonist for treating alcohol use disorder. The first study did not find reductions in heavy alcohol use after 26 weeks of medication treatment, except among those who had both obesity and an alcohol use disorder. The newest study published earlier this month found that among adults with alcohol use disorders, weekly low-dose semaglutide given over 9 weeks effectively reduced alcohol cravings and use when compared to a placebo. Clinical trials evaluating these medicines for tobacco cessation have found mixed results, with one showing positive effects of a GLP-agonist (exenatide) when taken in combination with nicotine replacement therapy and two trials showing no effects. More studies are needed to understand how well these medicines work to reduce alcohol and drug use, for whom they work best, and at what doses. Though more research is needed, the promise of these medicines is important for two reasons: 1. Since GLP-1 agonists act on brain circuits that are generally tied to reward and pleasure, both from food and drugs, it is possible that these medicines may be therapeutic for individuals who are addicted to more than one type of substance (i.e., polysubstance use or addiction). Currently, all the FDA-approved medicines for addictions are for a specific type of substance use disorder, but we don’t have any such options for addictions to multiple substances. 2. The stigma around addiction as a reflection of poor choices or flawed morals remains in our society. The promise of widely used and known medications such as Ozempic as potential treatment options to help people change their use of alcohol and drugs can help shift the conversation about addiction as an illness. This is an essential step towards helping people access much-needed treatments for this condition without shame and stigma as barriers. Based on what is currently known about GLP-1 agonist medications for addiction: 1. Some treatment providers may opt to prescribe them “off-label” to help someone overcome the addiction. Here’s what this means: Though not FDA-approved for this indication, some prescribing healthcare providers may feel that the research to date is compelling enough to warrant the use of these medications to treat addictions. Off-label prescribing is not at all an uncommon practice. The prescriber relies on their clinical judgment, in conjunction with the patient’s willingness to take a medicine that is not FDA-approved for the condition it’s being prescribed for, with a good understanding of the potential risks and benefits of doing so. 2. Research is in the early stages. It is important to be aware of the stage of research we’re currently in with GLP-1 agonists for addiction. With support for accelerated research currently in place from the National Institutes of Health, we are positioned to have scientifically based guidance on their use for addiction treatment a few years from now. In the meantime, we know that these medicines have promise, but we have a limited understanding of their safety, effectiveness, and ideal dosing for individuals with substance use disorders before more randomized clinical trials are conducted. More FDA-approved and unapproved (but promising) medication treatments to address substance misuse and addiction are covered in greater depth in my recently released book, Addiction: What Everyone Needs to Know."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-02-22T19:26:49.746149Z","updated_at":"2025-02-23T10:37:12.376237Z","inner_id":13,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":15,"annotations":[{"id":11,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":39,"end":47,"text":"PubMed

Knowles\/Bloomberg via Getty As appetite for blockbuster weight-loss drugs grows worldwide, scientists are developing the next crop of medications that, they hope, will improve the performance of these drugs and offer benefits beyond weight loss. “It’s going to be another year where, every week, there’s going to be something really cool,” says Daniel Drucker, an endocrinologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. New obesity definition sidelines BMI to focus on health New obesity definition sidelines BMI to focus on health Drug makers are building on the success of medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy, which contain the active ingredient semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. These drugs mimic the hormone GLP-1, helping to regulate blood-sugar levels and appetite. But most of these medications are costly, require weekly injections and need to be taken long-term to prevent weight regain. These are some of the issues that companies hope alternative drugs will address. Nature looks at the weight-loss medicines being tested in 2025 and what they have to offer. Tirzepatide — sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound and given by injection — mimics GLP-1 and another hormone called gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which is involved in fat metabolism. In trial results published in November, it helped participants to lose up to 20% of their body weight over 72 weeks and reduced the risk of diabetes, compared with a placebo. People taking semaglutide for 68 weeks lose up to 15% of their body weight. Participants who took tirzepatide also had a beneficial reduction in heart weight and in fat surrounding the heart, improved mobility and lower blood pressure and inflammation compared with people on a placebo. One trial expected to conclude in 2025 is examining tirzepatide’s effects on heart disease in people with obesity and diabetes. Retatrutide, which has not yet received regulatory approval for weight loss, activates receptors for GLP-1, GIP and glucagon, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Developed by Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, it has shown even more promising results than tirzepatide and semaglutide, with trial participants losing an average of 24% of their body weight over 11 months. The drug also helped to reduce blood-sugar levels in people with diabetes, and it’s now being tested in phase III trials that are expected to conclude by 2026. Anti-obesity drug has life-changing benefits for arthritis Anti-obesity drug has life-changing benefits for arthritis Researchers are excited about combination therapies such as retatrutide, says Beverly Tchang, an endocrinologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, who notes that obesity’s complexity makes targeting multiple pathways the most promising approach. Orforglipron, an oral small-molecule drug candidate also developed by Eli Lilly, showed similar results to GLP-1 injections in rodents, and led to a weight loss of about 10% over 26 weeks in people with obesity, improving blood pressure and levels of circulating fatty molecules. Like Ozempic, orforglipron is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, but whereas Ozempic requires injection, orforglipron comes as a daily pill. Lilly expects to complete phase III trials in 2025, and orforglipron could receive US regulatory approval in 2026, according to Lilly’s chief executive Dave Ricks. “The wild card is the oral small molecules,” says Randy Seeley, an obesity specialist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. Many companies are working on this approach, because pills might be more appealing and cost-effective than injections, but progress has been slower than expected owing to dosing challenges, he says. “If one of them finally breaks through, it has the ability to alter the landscape pretty considerably.” Biopharmaceutical company Amgen in Thousand Oaks, California, is planning a phase III trial of its drug candidate MariTide, which activates GLP-1 receptors while reducing GIP’s activity. The medication can be taken monthly by injection and resulted in an average weight loss of up to 20% over 52 weeks, according to data released by the company. Unlike other treatments, MariTide has shown the ability to maintain weight loss for several months after the last dose. When people stop taking semaglutide or tirzepatide, they tend to regain weight quickly, but that doesn’t seem to happen with MariTide, which might encourage more people to have the treatment, says Seeley, who consults for and receives funding from Amgen and other companies developing obesity drugs. or Nature 638, 591-592 (2025) doi: https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/d41586-025-00376-w Reprints and permissions Dozens of new obesity drugs are coming: these are the ones to watch News Feature 12 FEB 25 A comprehensive spatio-cellular map of the human hypothalamus Article 05 FEB 25 Obesity drugs: huge study identifies new health risks News 20 JAN 25 Rare genetic disorder treated in womb for the first time News 20 FEB 25 Plasmodium blood stage development requires the chromatin remodeller Snf2L Article 19 FEB 25 Human-correlated genetic models identify precision therapy for liver cancer Article 19 FEB 25 The School of Science and Engineering (SSE) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen) sincerely invites applications for mul...

The agency, along with maker Novo Nordisk, confirmed that supply now meets or exceeds both the current and projected U.S. demand. The injectable formulation of the GLP-1 receptor agonist has been in shortage since August 2022 due to increased demand. \"Patients and prescribers may still see intermittent and limited localized supply disruptions as the products move through the supply chain from the manufacturer and distributors to local pharmacies,\" the FDA noted in a statement. The shortage resolution applies to all strengths of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes, chronic weight management, and major adverse cardiovascular event risk reduction. The FDA said it will give compounders a grace period of 60 to 90 days to finish producing, distributing, and dispensing copies of semaglutide injection products to \"avoid unnecessary disruption to patient treatment.\" Compounders are allowed to make copies of a drug only when it's on the FDA shortage list, meaning the demand or projected demand of that drug exceeds the U.S. supply. \"We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand,\" said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations and global business development and president of Novo Nordisk, in a statement. \"No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients,\" he added. Two other GLP-1 receptor agonist products  --  dulaglutide (Trulicity) and liraglutide (Victoza, Saxenda)  --  still remain in shortage, the FDA noted.

By                    Dorothy Cucci Medications for weight loss have soared in popularity since 2017, when Ozempic was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). There are now nine types of FDA-approved GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) agonists — a class of prescription drugs for weight loss. A recent poll found that 1 in 8 U.S. adults had tried or are using GLP-1s. Scientists are also finding new uses for the breakthrough weight-loss drugs, which were originally designed for diabetic and medically overweight patients. Recently, the FDA announced Ozempic can be used to reduce the risk of chronic kidney disease. Wegovy won FDA approval to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, or cardiovascular death, and Zepbound recently became the first drug approved for obstructive sleep apnea. Research is still early, but the medications may eventually be used for a host of other medical conditions. A new, large-scale study published in the journal Nature Medicine reported that Ozempic and similar medications for weight loss may lower risk of 42 health conditions, including Alzheimer’s, substance use disorders, and mental health conditions. “Weight affects so many chronic medical conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol, fatty liver, and certain cancers — as well as issues like sleep apnea and osteoarthritis,” says Dr. Mohini Aras, an obesity medicine specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian\/Weill Cornell Medical Center. “Our goal with weight loss is to improve these conditions, and even a modest weight loss of 5% to 10% can make a difference.” Dr. Aras spoke with Health Matters about how drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy work, who should (and shouldn’t) take them, and their risks and side effects. Dr. Mohini Aras How do medications for weight loss work?Dr. Aras: First, it’s important to understand that our brain is designed to defend against starvation and retain our weight. When we lose weight, naturally occurring hormones send a message to our brain to increase hunger and cravings and slow our metabolism down. Our brain even makes our muscles more efficient, so we don’t burn as many calories with the same activity; this is a starvation response. As a result, people tend to yo-yo: They will lose, regain, lose, and regain weight. Medications for weight loss activate the hormones that we naturally produce to regulate weight. These medications target appetite and hunger, helping people feel full sooner and stay full longer. They may also impact cravings, thoughts of food, and binge eating. The first anti-obesity medicines were stimulants that were approved in the late 1950s, and we’ve seen a lot of advances in the field of obesity medicine in the last 10 years. How are these medicines taken?Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound (which all contain the active ingredient semaglutide) are once-weekly injectable medications. They come as a pen, and you do the injection yourself at home. It’s a subcutaneous injection, so you can do it in your upper thigh, in your abdomen, or in your arm, and it’s a tiny needle that is just enough to poke the skin — so it’s not too bothersome for people. An oral version, Rybelsus (which contains the active ingredient tirzepatide), is taken once a day, typically on an empty stomach when you first wake up. The pills are easier to transport, as opposed to the injectables, which have specific temperature requirements. Both Ozempic and Wegovy may also soon be available in the form of a daily pill, and two recent studies showed that the oral versions are about as effective as the injectables. How can you get a prescription?We require a comprehensive medical evaluation, including labs, vitals, and a full medical history. We tailor individual plans for patients, with the foundation being diet and physical activity, and select appropriate weight loss medications that can help support the hard work that they are doing. We also have a team of providers, including registered dieticians, nurse practitioners, and physicians, who aid patients in achieving their health goals. Patients who have histories of gallbladder disease, pancreatitis, or family histories of medullary thyroid cancer or rare disorders of the endocrine system may not be eligible. How much do they cost?These medicines are quite expensive if they’re not covered by insurance — from $900 to $1,400 a month. We have an entire pharmacy team dedicated to processing the authorizations required by insurances to try to obtain these medications for our patients. Obesity is chronic, so when we start a medication, we have to plan for it long-term. Given the cost of being on these medications, most of my patients wouldn’t be able to afford these drugs without insurance coverage. Can these medications also help with addiction?Medications for weight loss improve satiety and reduce cravings. Clinically, many patients do report a reduction in their interest in alcohol — and that’s a type of craving. It’s important to remember that these medicines work while you take them, so the benefit of reduced cravings won’t persist once the medicine is no longer circulating in your body. How long do patients have to remain on weight-loss medication?Obesity and type 2 diabetes are chronic medical conditions that require long-term management. I tell my patients to plan for long-term use, which is why cost is important to discuss up front. What are the side effects of taking medications for weight loss?These drugs directly act on the gastrointestinal system. One of the ways they work is by slowing the gastric emptying, so the food sits in your stomach longer before it goes into your intestines. That’s how it can make people feel full sooner and stay full longer, but that’s where the side effects come in as well — because food’s sitting there, it can cause some reflux, nausea, a sense of overfullness, diarrhea, or constipation. The injectable medicines are most potent the first few days after the injection, and that’s when the side effects can be most prominent. In general, we start with the lowest dose and gradually escalate as needed; we always want to use the least amount of medicine possible to facilitate weight loss. I’ve seen a common misconception that the side effects of drugs like Ozempic are horrible, but, for the most part, that’s not been my clinical experience. The gastric slowing is something that is known about this class of medications and contributes to the gastrointestinal side effects, but for the vast majority of people, they are able to tolerate the medications well. It’s important to reduce portions and eat slowly to mitigate side effects. Our practice at the Comprehensive Weight Control Center has used these medicines for a long time; we have a lot of tips and tricks that make them more tolerable for patients who are sensitive to the side effects. What would you say to patients who are interested in these drugs but may be feeling ashamed to ask about them?Physicians have failed people who struggle with weight for decades. We have told them to eat less and exercise more, and now we know that’s not sufficient for the vast majority of people. Obesity is a chronic disease with several root causes that requires medical management. I would encourage patients to seek more information to understand if they would be good candidates for these medications.

US Food and Drug Administration has determined that semaglutide is no longer in shortage, a move that will have implications for patients taking cheaper, compounded versions of the drug. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss medications Ozempic and Wegovy, has been on the FDA’s shortage list since March 2022. Supply could not keep pace with fervent demand for the drug, which reached such dizzying levels of popularity that it transformed Novo Nordisk into one of the world’s most valuable companies, with a market capitalization larger than the rest of the economy of its home nation of Denmark. In the intervening years, a lucrative industry of telehealth companies, medical spas, and pharmacies making and selling “compounded” copies of the medications has arisen. These off-brand copies are sold at a steep discount—sometimes under $100 a vial—compared to the name-brand medications, which can be over $1,000 a month without insurance. At the end of October, the FDA changed the status of all dosages of Ozempic and Wegovy to “available,” signaling that the end of the official shortage was likely in sight. It took until today, nearly four months later, for regulators to conclude that the drug was widely available enough to remove it from the shortage list. The FDA is giving “503A” compounders, typically state-licensed pharmacies or physician compounders that run smaller operations, until April 22 to cease producing the drug. It is giving “503B” compounders, which are larger outsourcing facilities that follow stricter manufacturing guidelines, until May 22. Under ordinary circumstances, it’s not especially contentious when drugs come off a shortage list. But there is reason to believe that players within this industry will push back on this announcement. Drug compounding is a well-established practice; pharmacists are permitted to make copies of medications when there’s a drug shortage or when patients need versions made in specific dosages or without allergens. But the GLP-1 boom has created an opportunity for compounders that has transformed pockets of the industry, with compounding pharmacies producing off-brand duplicates for likely millions of patients. Robert MacArthur, director of pharmacy at the Rockefeller University Hospital, says that once a drug comes off the FDA shortage list, outsourcing pharmacies that make large batches of compounded drugs for health care facilities are not supposed to compound that drug anymore. But for smaller, traditional compounding pharmacies that make drugs for home use, it’s a legal gray area. “They can compound it if the physician writes the prescription for an individual patient and feels there’s some compelling reason why that given patient needs that special compounded product,” MacArthur says. That reason could be adjusting the dose or tailoring the medication to a specific patient. Some telehealth outfits have signaled their intention to continue offering their products.“Now that the FDA has determined the drug shortage for semaglutide has been resolved, we will continue to offer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law to meet patient needs,” Andrew Dudum, founder and CEO of Hims & Hers Health, wrote on X, adding that the company is closely monitoring potential future shortages. In December, the FDA declared that tirzepatide, the other popular GLP-1 drug, was no longer in shortage. The small 503A compounders had 60 days to stop production, while the larger 503B outsourcing facilities had 90 days to wrap up sales. Eli Lilly, which sells tirzepatide under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound, sent a flurry of cease-and-desist letters to hundreds of companies selling compounded versions. The compounding industry pushed back, with a trade group filing a lawsuit against the FDA, arguing that the drug was actually still hard to access for patients. As of now, the FDA has set deadlines for compounders to stop producing tirzepatide products, but it is not enforcing the deadlines at the moment as the lawsuit is ongoing. Novo Nordisk has already attempted to curb the compounded semaglutide market. It has filed over 50 lawsuits against compounders, telehealth clinics, and medspas, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. More recently, it has petitioned the FDA to block production of compounded semaglutide by placing the ingredient on the “Demonstrable Difficulties for Compounding” list, which excludes drugs that are too difficult to compound safely. “We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand. No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients,” Novo Nordisk executive Dave Moore said in a statement. (The FDA does not evaluate compounded medications for safety, quality, or efficacy before they are sold.) “I think the compounders have a real valid argument,” MacArthur says. “This is a drug that is going to prolong people’s lives and meaningfully increase the quality of their life. You’ve already got a whole population of compounders out there that are making it, the product quality is adequate, people are using it, and then you’re suddenly going to take it away? I mean, I think that that would create a public uproar.” Updated: 2\/21\/2024, 2:29 pm EST: This story was updated to quote from a post from the founder and CEO of Hims & Hers

weight-loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic are no longer in shortage, the US Food and Drug Administration said on Friday. The update about the popular semaglutide injections from drug manufacturer Novo Nordisk follows just two months after the FDA said that shortages of tirzepatide injections Zepbound and Mounjaro from competitor Eli Lilly had also ended. “We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand,” Dave Moore, president of Novo Nordisk Inc., said in a statement Friday. Related article Ozempic shown to reduce drinking in first trial in alcohol-use disorder GLP-1 drugs had been in shortage since 2022 due to increased demand, and a law allowed compounding pharmacies to step in to fill supply gaps during those years. Compounded drugs use the same active ingredients but are made by pharmacies or manufacturers other than the companies that make FDA-approved versions of the medicines. This enabled thousands, or even millions, of people to access costly GLP-1 medicines at a lower price point. The end of the shortage would effectively bar the sale of compounded versions of the drugs, but the FDA said that they do not plan to take any action against compounding pharmacies for 60 to 90 days. “Patients and prescribers may still see intermittent and limited localized supply disruptions as the products move through the supply chain from the manufacturer and distributors to local pharmacies,” the FDA said on Friday. The FDA announced a similar policy for pharmacies making tirzepatide compounds when that shortage was resolved in December. In August, drug manufacturer Eli Lilly began sending cease-and-desist letters to telehealth companies, wellness centers and medical spas selling compounded versions of Zepbound and Mounjaro, according to Reuters. The company has also filed lawsuits against sellers falsely claiming to sell FDA-approved versions of the drug. Related article What you should know about carbonated water and weight loss On Friday, drug manufacturer Novo Nordisk warned in a news release that the “FDA’s decision means that making or selling a knockoff compounded drug that is essentially a copy of Ozempic or Wegovy is illegal.” The company has already filed more than 100 lawsuits related to “copycat” semaglutide products, most under claims of false advertising or deceptive and unfair trade practices. “No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients,” company president Moore said in a statement Friday. The FDA has issued safety warnings about some compounded versions of semaglutide. The agency said that it received reports of adverse events in people who used compounded semaglutide and that patients “should not use a compounded drug if an approved drug is available.” But the Outsourcing Facilities Association, a trade group representing companies that make certain compounded medications, has sued the FDA over its removal of tirzepatide from the shortage list claiming that it happened “without notice, without soliciting input from affected parties and the public, and without meaningful rationale.” Olympia Pharmaceuticals says that they provide compounded GLP-1 medications – the vast majority of which are semaglutide – to tens of thousands of patients each week, and there hasn’t been sufficient reassurance for prescribers to feel confident that supply is strong enough to meet demand. “Our biggest concern would be that patient continuity of care. If we were to no longer be able to dispense this to patients, that Novo Nordisk and these brand name suppliers are able to pick up that demand where we left off,” said Josh Fritzler, chief financial officer with Olympia. While the “national GLP-1 supply begins to stabilize,” the FDA notes that some other products – including dulaglutide injections sold under the brand name Trulicity and some liraglutide injections – remain in shortage.

Her relationship with her body changed when she joined a gym to get fit. “Seeing results inspired me and I began developing a healthier perspective about my body,\" says Advani for whom the topic of ‘body positivity’ seems like a puzzle. “It has many layers\" she adds, admitting that having friends and acquaintances who aren’t ashamed of their body type certainly helps.        “Someone who grew up skinny and put on weight later will have a different self-image and relationship with their body compared to someone who grew up fat and lost weight later in life,\" says Niharica Shah, Pune-based psychologist. Shah’s work has her regularly interacting with women and queer folk, who struggle with their weight or body image. “Weight is not a good indicator of wellness. I never recommend that my clients take diet pills or do intensive workouts that prioritise weight loss over other aspects of their health,\" she reveals. Instead, her counsel to her clients is to cultivate a meaningful relationship with their body where they identify and reframe what true indicators of health are for them; focus on qualities that cannot be numerically measured like kindness and creativity; and challenge narratives that make them feel bad about something they cannot change about themselves.        While Kovil underlines the ill-effects of obesity through ailments like fatty liver, respiratory disorders, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and more, he strongly feels that obesity\/diabetes drugs should be prescribed only by specialists who are aware of their side effects. “Weight loss is a slow journey, which should be sustainable, and be supported by behavioural change, cognitive therapy and pharmacological therapy, only if needed,\" he says.        While it’s a little ahead of time to speculate how Mounjaro will be received in India, it’s probably a good idea to deliberate on, to quote US-based Aubrey Gordon, co-host of the Maintenance Phase podcast, “How do we design a better discourse that isn’t so wildly dehumanizing to fat people and diabetic people.\"  Sumitra Nair is an independent journalist based in Kochi, Kerala.  Also read: Valentine’s Day: Can sex toys enhance intimacy in your relationship?

As for how she deals with comments about weight, D’Souza says, “If someone makes a remark about my weight, I simply make it known to them that they cannot talk to me like that.\" Also read: Eli Lilly likely to launch weight loss & anti-diabetes drug in India: Is it safe to consume? Krisha Advani, 21, based in Chennai is a typical Gen-Z kid who lives her life on the ’gram. The content creator leaned on the heavier side during her teen years and struggled with issues around her weight. “I was very conscious of the clothes I wore, I never wore anything sleeveless,\" she recalls. Her relationship with her body changed when she joined a gym to get fit. “Seeing results inspired me and I began developing a healthier perspective about my body,\" says Advani for whom the topic of ‘body positivity’ seems like a puzzle. “It has many layers\" she adds, admitting that having friends and acquaintances who aren’t ashamed of their body type certainly helps. “Someone who grew up skinny and put on weight later will have a different self-image and relationship with their body compared to someone who grew up fat and lost weight later in life,\" says Niharica Shah, Pune-based psychologist. Shah’s work has her regularly interacting with women and queer folk, who struggle with their weight or body image. “Weight is not a good indicator of wellness. I never recommend that my clients take diet pills or do intensive workouts that prioritise weight loss over other aspects of their health,\" she reveals. Instead, her counsel to her clients is to cultivate a meaningful relationship with their body where they identify and reframe what true indicators of health are for them; focus on qualities that cannot be numerically measured like kindness and creativity; and challenge narratives that make them feel bad about something they cannot change about themselves. While Kovil underlines the ill-effects of obesity through ailments like fatty liver, respiratory disorders, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and more, he strongly feels that obesity\/diabetes drugs should be prescribed only by specialists who are aware of their side effects. “Weight loss is a slow journey, which should be sustainable, and be supported by behavioural change, cognitive therapy and pharmacological therapy, only if needed,\" he says. While it’s a little ahead of time to speculate how Mounjaro will be received in India, it’s probably a good idea to deliberate on, to quote US-based Aubrey Gordon, co-host of the Maintenance Phase podcast, “How do we design a better discourse that isn’t so wildly dehumanizing to fat people and diabetic people.\" Sumitra Nair is an independent journalist based in Kochi, Kerala.

At the end of the 20th century, endocrinologist Daniel Drucker was looking for a hormone similar enough to the human gut's GLP-1, which would have similar appetite-suppressing and blood sugar-regulating qualities, without being broken down by the human body so quickly. Drucker had read about the work of endocrinologist John Eng, gastroenterologist Jean-Pierre Raufman and biochemist John Pisano, who had sequenced the proteins in Gila monster  (Heloderma suspectum) venom and found two that looked like human GLP-1. Drucker and his team from the University of Toronto acquired a Gila monster from the Utah Zoo's breeding program to dissect for further research. This work confirmed that the lizard species' unique genes produce a protein, Exendin-4, that fit the bill, mimicking GLP-1 while hanging round in the human body for far longer. A synthetic version was created in the years after, but it took until 2005 for this GLP-1 agonist to become an FDA-approved treatment for type 2 diabetes. It's now also become a popular treatment for obesity, with further potential applications on the horizon. This isn't the only time we've relied on the chemical arsenal of toxic animals. Life-saving drugs have emerged from the crucible of the natural world many times throughout history. One of the top-selling drugs worldwide originates, ironically, from a snake's venom – but it's far from 'snake oil'. Lisinopril reduces the chemicals that constrict blood flow, which is why it's prescribed for high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, and to heart attack survivors. But the maker of its natural form, the Brazilian viper (Bothrops jararaca), evolved to produce enzyme inhibitors that help venom spread smoothly through the doomed body of its prey. Sea sponges are among the most ancient animals on this planet, so they've had a long time to cook up some interesting molecules. The Caribbean sponge (Tectitethya crypta) produces strange nucleosides which, in lieu of an immune system, protect it from the onslaught of foreign DNA introduced to its sessile body by predators and prey as it filter feeds. These nucleosides provided the inspiration for the chemotherapy drug cytarabine, which is among the WHO's List of Essential Medicines for its use in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia. Animal toxins are proving useful in treating other cancers, too. In 2004, oncologist Jim Olson was dismayed to discover that even after a 14-hour surgery to remove a tumor from a teenage girl's brain, a thumb-sized piece of the cancer had been left behind. He assembled a team to find a molecule that would help surgeons see cancers with the naked eye, and thanks to newly assembled DNA databases, they were able to find a suitable candidate in a matter of weeks. Its unlikely origin? The venom of one of the most dangerous scorpions on Earth, the deathstalker (Leiurus quinquestriatus). In isolation, the peptide chlorotoxin Cy5.5 had already been found to bind to ion channels on brain tumor cells, but not to normal human cells. The lab-made version, Tozuleristide, creates a kind of light-up 'paint' under near-infrared that has allowed researchers to see cancerous clusters as small as a few hundred cells in rodent studies. From GLP-1 agonists to chemotherapy treatments, it's incredible that the toxic potions brewed up by the animal kingdom can be used to improve and save human lives. And a humbling reminder that the answers to our problems may be found in unexpected places, if we are willing to look further afield, and of course, if those species and their habitats still exist by the time we get there.

shortage of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+5.33%) blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs is officially over, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA updated its drug shortage database on Friday, marking the shortage of semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — as resolved. The news puts pressure on companies that have been able to sell off-brand, also known as compounded versions, of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs due to widespread shortages. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, have become highly sought after for their weight loss effects. Soaring sales for these treatments have transformed Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+0.44%), the maker of competing drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. However, Skyrocketing demand and the drugs’ high list price has made it difficult for some patients to fill their prescriptions. Semaglutide had been listed on the FDA shortage list since March 2022. “We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand,” said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients.” Novo Nordisk stock jumped over 4% on Friday. The millennial-focused telehealth platform Hims & Hers (HIMS-24.45%), which began offering a compounded version of semaglutide last May, saw its stock drop by over 22% during Friday’s trading session. Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the FDA to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand name weight-loss drugs has spurred several digital healthcare companies to take advantage of that provision. “Now that the FDA has determined the drug shortage for semaglutide has been resolved, we will continue to offer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law to meet patient needs,” Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum said in a statement. “We’re also closely monitoring potential future shortages, as Novo Nordisk stated two weeks ago that it would continue to have ‘capacity limitations’ and ‘expected continued periodic supply constraints and related drug shortage notifications.’” In July, the company added Kåre Schultz, a longtime Novo Nordisk executive, to its board of directors. At the time, Schultz told Bloomberg that the company has a “long future” in selling compounded semaglutide. When asked if pharmacies will still be able to make compounded semaglutide after the shortages end, Schulz said he wasn’t worried because there would still be cases where patients need individualized prescriptions. The FDA said on Friday that state-licensed pharmacies and physicians, known as 503A compounders, must stop making and distributing semaglutide products by April 22. Outsourcing facilities, known as 503B’s, have until May 22 to do the same. However, the FDA’s decision will likely face challenges from compounders, who have already sued the agency over its decision to declare a shortage of another weight-loss drug as resolved. The FDA originally declared the shortage of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound — over in October. However, an industry group, the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA), filed a lawsuit in Texas against the agency just days later, challenging its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed. In its lawsuit, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary,” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” The FDA said, in a court filing, that pharmacists could temporarily resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision In a December letter, the agency stated that its review found Eli Lilly has sufficient supply to meet and exceed both current and future demand for the drugs. As a result, it set deadlines for compounding pharmacies — Feb. 18 for 503As and Mar. 19 for 503B’s — to stop selling off-brand versions of tirzepatide.
