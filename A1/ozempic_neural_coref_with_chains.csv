Muscle loss on Ozempic: Antibody treatment may help prevent decline,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/novel-antibody-help-prevent-bone-muscle-loss-glp-1-drugs-ozempic-wegovy,"Studies suggest that weight loss induced by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs can also cause a decline in muscle mass and bone mineral density, similar to that observed in aging. A new study published in the Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia, and Muscle suggests that the antibody bimagrumab is effective in increasing muscle mass and bone density in a mouse model of muscle and bone loss. These findings suggest that bimagrumab could potentially help preserve not only muscle mass, as shown by previous research, but also help prevent bone loss in individuals using GLP-1 drugs for weight loss. The study’s author, Frederik Duch Bromer, a researcher at Aarhus University, Denmark, said, “Since the rise of incretin therapies like Wegovy and Mounjaro, scientists have been searching for ways to counteract the loss of muscle and bone mass often accompanying rapid weight loss. Our research shows that bimagrumab can mitigate even more severe muscle and bone loss than what typically occurs with weight loss therapies.” “As bimagrumab is now being repurposed to help preserve lean mass during weight loss, its ability to protect bone as well is especially relevant given the large number of people using these treatments,” Bromer told Medical News Today. A loss of muscle mass and a decline in bone density are common features of aging that often occur together. The loss of muscle mass and strength with aging is referred to as sarcopenia, whereas the decrease in bone mass and bone mineral density is referred to as osteoporosis. Besides old age, limited physical activity can also lead to muscle loss and osteoporosis. While medications are available for the treatment of osteoporosis, there is a lack of approved treatments for muscle loss. One of the categories of drugs currently under investigation for the treatment of muscle loss includes drugs that inhibit the activation of the activin receptor or the signaling pathway activated by this receptor. Inhibition of the activin signaling pathway leads to increased muscle mass and bone formation and enhanced blood cell formation. The antibody bimagrumab is an example of one such drug that binds to the activin receptors to inhibit the activation of the activin signaling pathway. Similar to other inhibitors of the activin signaling pathway, animal and clinical studies have shown that bimagrumab can increase muscle mass and lean body mass. The use of GLP-1 receptor agonists is associated with muscle mass loss and a decline in bone density. Currently, bimagrumab is being investigated in a clinical trial to evaluate its ability to prevent muscle loss in individuals using Wegovy, a type of GLP-1 drug. Bones and muscles not only cooperate with each other during movements, but muscles also release small proteins called myokines that impact bone health. However, it is not known whether bimagrumab can also simultaneously improve bone health along with increasing muscle mass. In the present study, researchers examined whether bimagrumab could improve bone health and increase muscle mass simultaneously. The inhibitors of the activin signaling pathway can also lead to an increase in blood cell production and potentially increase the risk of blood clots. Hence, it is essential to assess the risk of blood clots due to bimagrumab before it can be considered for preventing muscle and bone loss. In the present study, the researchers assessed the impact of bimagrumab on muscle and bone mass in healthy and immobilized mice, with the latter serving as a model of bone and muscle loss. To simulate the simultaneous loss of muscle mass and bone density, the researchers injected a group of mice with botulinum toxin into the quadriceps and the gastrocnemius, the major muscles of the hindlimb. The botulinum toxin causes paralysis of the hindlimb muscles, resulting in immobilization of the animal, followed by muscle mass loss and a decline in bone density. The healthy and immobilized mice in the bimagrumab group received two weekly antibody injections over 21 days, whereas those in the control groups received an injection of the vehicle. After 21 days, the mice in all groups were euthanized, and the muscles and bones in the right hindlimb were removed and evaluated. The researchers found that bimagrumab increased muscle mass, the size of muscle fibers, and bone mineral density in the hindlimb of both free-moving and immobilized mice. Bimagrumab also promoted new bone formation, including at the end of the thigh bone or femur, which is prone to fracture in older individuals. The scientists observed that the increase in muscle mass and bone mineral density was smaller in the immobilized mice, likely due to the potent action of botulinum toxin. Yet, these results demonstrate that bimagrumab could potentially help increase muscle mass and bone density in individuals at risk of sarcopenia and osteoporosis. The researchers also examined the impact of bimagrumab on blood cell formation at two and seven days after the injection of the antibody. Bimagrumab did not have an impact on blood cell formation or any other related factors, suggesting its safety for preserving muscle and bone mass in patients using GLP-1 drugs. However, more research and larger clinical trials will be needed to determine its effectiveness and safety. “While our study focused on a model of muscle and bone loss, it did not specifically examine bone loss related to obesity. Since weight loss drugs are mainly used by people with obesity, it is essential to explore how bimagrumab interacts with bone affected by obesity,” Bromer added.","Studies suggest Studies suggest loss Studies suggestduced by mineral density, similar (GLP-1) drugs can mineral density, similar (GLP-1) Studies weight loss Studies suggestduced by Studies suggest mineral density, similar (GLP-1) Studies a declStudies suggeste Studies suggest Studies mass and Studies suggest that observed Studies suggest agStudies suggestg.

Denmark Ozempic card to Trump Greenland threat - Trump Greenland threat Denmark may halt Ozempic obesity drug - India Today,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/donald-trump-greenland-tariff-threat-denmark-ozempic-weight-loss-drug-legos-2673180-2025-02-01,"Listen to Story If US President Donald Trump is indeed serious about his threat to acquire Greenland, the autonomous Danish territory, it may well affect the weight-loss journey of millions of obese Americans. Puzzled? The equation is simple. Denmark, despite having a population smaller than New York, has several trump cards up its sleeve, with the foremost being curbing or halting the exports of the popular weight-loss drug Ozempic and kids' favourite Lego toys. Ever since Trump won the US presidential election, the Republican has on several occasions floated the idea of buying Greenland. He has only escalated the pitch after taking over as US President last month, threatening punitive tariffs and even hinting at military action to take control of the strategically important island. However, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, in a fiery phone call with Trump, made it clear that Greenland was ""not for sale"", the BBC reported. DENMARK TARIFF THREAT MAY HURT WAISTLINES OF AMERICANS The issue has threatened the possibility of an all-out trade war between the US and its NATO ally. However, it may turn out to be a pain in the waistlines of millions of Americans. In the past two years, the drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, made by Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk, have revolutionised obesity and diabetes treatment in the United States - which has one of the highest obesity rates in the world. In fact, CDC data shows that in 23 American states, more than one in three adults (35%) has obesity. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has revealed that between 2021 and 2023, the number of Ozempic prescriptions in the US has jumped by 400 per cent. In the backdrop of this, if Trump does go on with steep tariffs on Denmark, it could jack up the prices of Ozempic and Wegovy. Presently, Americans have to shell out nearly $1,000 for each packet of Ozempic (without discounts or insurance). For Wegovy, it is $1,300 per package. The price of the drugs is already higher in the US than in other countries. Additionally, data by Trading Economics shows that the US imported medicines, vaccines and antibiotics worth $5.7 billion from ""pharma state"" Denmark in 2023. Even if the US wants to make such drugs from scratch, it doesn't have the resources as the active ingredient for Ozempic and Wegovy, called semaglutide, is made in Denmark. The widely popular Lego Group, the world's largest toymaker, is also based in Denmark. Besides, Denmark is also the leading supplier of hearing aids to America. Thus, even if Trump decides to go on with his tariff threats, there is no shortage of economic leverage for Denmark to hurt the United States.Published By: Abhishek DePublished On: Feb 1, 2025Must Watch","Puzzled? serious serious serious serious President having a indeed serious about serious threat serious Puzzled?

FDA: Ozempic and Wegovy drug shortage is over,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/02/21/ozempic-wegovy-drug-shortage-is-over-fda/79428396007/,"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday said the shortage of Novo Nordisk's weight-loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic is resolved, a move that could limit the availability of cheaper compounded versions of the wildly popular medications. In a statement, the FDA said it confirmed Novo Nordisk's ""stated product availability and manufacturing capacity"" of these prescription drugs meets or exceeds current and projected demand. The agency warned consumers and doctors might still experience ""limited localized supply disruptions"" as the products are shipped from drug factories to distributors to pharmacies. The Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk said it has invested $6.5 billion this year in the United States to bolster drug production facilities that are operating 24/7, shipping Wegovy and Ozempic to wholesalers. Pharmaceutical giants that market lucrative weight-loss drugs have battled with firms that sell less expensive versions made by compounding pharmacies. The FDA allows compounding pharmacies to sell copies of drugs when the medications are in short supply. But compounding pharmacies face stiffer restrictions when a drug shortage is resolved. Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle. Companies that market compounded drugs − combining, mixing or altering drug ingredients − have prospered amid shortages of the class of weight-loss medications, called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists. Hims & Hers, which launched a Super Bowl ad touting its weight loss product offerings, markets a compounded version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. Shares of Hims & Hers plunged 17% in mid-morning trading after the FDA's announcement. The FDA said it won't take enforcement action against pharmacies or doctors that make compounded semaglutide due to the shortage before April 22. Facilities that compound, distribute or dispense semaglutide injections won't face enforcement action before May 22. In December, the FDA declared that Eli Lilly's weight loss and diabetes medication tirzepatide, sold under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound, was no longer in short supply. That meant pharmacies had to discontinue ""compounding, distributing or dispensing"" tirzepatide as of Feb 18. Suppliers that produce batches of the drug and sell to others have until March 19 to cease distribution. Compounding pharmacies are regulated by state boards of pharmacy and source ingredients are usually obtained from factories registered with the FDA. However, the federal agency doesn't verify the safety or effectiveness of compounding pharmacies.","Drug compoundednd Drug Administrcompoundedtion on Fridcompoundedy scompoundedid the shortcompoundedge of Drug Administration compoundednd dicompoundedbetes drugs Wegovy compoundednd Drug resolved, compounded move thcompoundedt could limit the compoundedvcompoundedilcompoundedbility of checompoundedper compounded versions of the wildly populcompoundedr mediccompoundedtions.

FDA declares end to Wegovy and Ozempic shortage - CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-declares-end-to-wegovy-and-ozempic-shortage/,"                      Alexander Tin Edited By                       Nicole Brown Chau February 21, 2025 / 11:42 AM EST           / CBS News The Food and Drug Administration announced Friday it had officially declared an end to the nationwide shortage of Ozempic and Wegovy, medications used for diabetes and weight loss. The agency first declared a shortage of semaglutide, the main ingredient used to make Ozempic and Wegovy, in 2022. The FDA's announcement comes months after drugmaker Novo Nordisk told the agency that all dosages of its semaglutide product had become fully available nationwide. The company said in a statement that it confirms the supply of the medications, which are prescription-only, ""now meets or exceeds both current and projected U.S. demand."" ""This update comes after ongoing dialogue with the FDA, and substantial efforts by Novo Nordisk to increase manufacturing capacity, including $6.5 billion dollars of investments in the U.S. this year alone,"" the drugmaker said. The FDA said that it will allow compounding pharmacies to continue to make copies of semaglutide for now, which they are usually allowed to do only while the drug is in shortage. That leeway will continue until April 22 for many pharmacies and May 22 for outsourcing facilities to ""avoid unnecessary disruption"" to patients, the agency said. This is similar to what the FDA has granted compounding pharmacies making copies of Eli Lilly's diabetes and weight loss drug tirzepatide, amid an ongoing lawsuit brought by outsourcing facilities disputing the FDA's decision to declare the shortage of that weight loss drug over. Some compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities have made millions making copies of semaglutide and tirzepatide during their shortages in recent years, amid a flurry of companies cashing in on demand for the drugs. The FDA is also facing calls to do more to crack down on counterfeits of the drugs, including from state attorneys general who urged the agency this week to stop illegal imports from overseas. ""Demand for the medications Mounjaro, Zepbound, Ozempic, and Wegovy (GLP-1 drugs) has skyrocketed, but supply shortages and high costs have created opportunities for wrongdoers to cash in and endanger consumers,"" they wrote.

According to a health ministry study quoted in the report, in Brazil’s largest cities, obesity increased to 24 percent in 2023 from nearly 12 percent in 2006. An NYT analysis of the São Paulo State database showed that theft of Ozempic has risen in the last three years—from one incident in 2022 when four boxes of Ozempic were taken from a single drugstore to 18 in 2023 and 39 in 2024. “The wave of thefts began when social media started openly discussing the drug, particularly as celebrity and influencers showcased dramatic weight loss,” Renata Goncalves, head of a union of pharmacists in Sao Paulo, told the NYT. The desperation for the drug is real, and world over, the black market is thriving. Break-ins at pharmacies have also been reported in Michigan, US, and Santiago de Copostela, Spain.  In Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro, for instance, free Ozempic even became a campaign promise when the mayor actively advocated the drug for weight loss and promised to make it available for free. “Rio will be a city where there will be no more fat people; everyone will be taking Ozempic at family clinics,” the mayor said while seeking re-election last year. “This is the first time I’ve seen weight loss drugs actually targeted for theft,” Issa Shain, Police chief in Dearborn, Michigan, told the media. But the drugs are not cheap and are seen as a luxury item. In India, people are spending as much as Rs 80,000 on a six-month course or scouring the black market for a shot. There are fears that this trend will continue to rise. The patent for semaglutide, the main ingredient of the Ozempic drug, will expire in 2026 in a number of countries, including India, China and Brazil.

Ozempic May Reduce Bone Density; Know Other Possible Side Effects,https://www.ndtv.com/health/ozempic-may-reduce-bone-density-know-other-possible-side-effects-7586940,"Ozempic (semaglutide) is a prescription medication primarily used to manage type-2 diabetes. It lowers blood sugar levels in people with diabetes and also reduces heart disease risk in people with diabetes. In addition to its glucose-lowering effect, Ozempic has been associated with reduced appetite and weight loss. It has recently gained popularity and people across the world are using it for quick weight loss. However, it is not the safest and healthiest way to lose weight. Overuse of Ozempic is linked with several side effects. Recently, in an Instagram video, singer Avery revealed that she had been diagnosed with osteoporosis after taking Ozempic for a year for weight loss. In her video, she urged her Instagram followers not to ""make the same mistake."" A healthy diet with regular exercise can help with sustainable weight loss. However, the use of Ozempic may contribute to sudden weight loss which can cause a decrease in muscle mass, low bone density and poor metabolic rate. Some studies also suggest that overuse of this drug can make your bones brittle and increase the risk of fractures. ""There is very little direct evidence that suggests the link between Ozempic use and osteoporosis. Significant weight loss, however, does have an impact on bone density that could increase the risk of osteoporosis in the elderly. It is important to monitor bone health in any treatment of weight loss,"" says Dr. Vineet Kumar Surana, Consultant - Diabetes and Endocrinology at Manipal Hospital. ""For those who are planning to take or have already taken Ozempic, they should monitor their bone health,"" urged Dr. Kumar. He has further recommended the following tips for optimal bone health: As we already know, Ozempic contains an ingredient called semaglutide which is prescribed primarily for managing type-2 diabetes. It helps in regulating blood sugar levels and can lead to weight reduction. Semaglutide mimics the GLP-1 hormone which ultimately increases a feeling of fullness, and reduces appetite, leading to decreased calorie intake and weight loss.

Dr. Reddy’s, which has profited the most from the drug’s sales, and Natco, which led the launch and will see its share of the total Revlimid market grow to 33% by March 2025, will be the most impacted next year, according to analysts.        While Natco is expecting robust growth from Revlimid sales in FY26, as its market share increases to 33%, brokerage ICICI Direct Research expects a 50-60% drop in profits in FY27, following the waning of Revlimid.        Dr. Reddy’s, whose Ebitda surged from  ₹5,140 crore in FY22 to  ₹8,301 crore in FY24, significantly profiting from Revlimid sales, is also facing a market share loss in Revlimid.

While the US patent for the Semaglutide expires in FY31, the India patent expires next year, and the company is geared for an India launch.        “If we get all regulatory clearances on time for Semaglutide, we will be able to launch it 1HFY26,"" a Natco spokesperson told Mint in an emailed response.        Dr. Reddy’s is eyeing a Canada launch in January 2026. “I believe we are positioned well to get approval for that period of time,"" Dr. Reddy’s CEO Erez Israeli said in an earnings call in January. “Normally, between the time that you submit the product to the Canadian authorities, until you get approval, is 12 to 14 months…So what you're going to see is probably the sequence in which people will get approval, and we hope to be the first one in the pack,"" he added.        But that’s not all.

The company is looking at the launch of biosimilar Abatacept in the US by the end of FY27. ““Abatacept is a $3-4 billion product in the US, if Dr. Reddy’s is the only company to launch that product for at least one year, their sales could be upward of $100 million for that product,"" Chalke said.        Together, Semaglutide and Abatacept may be able to substantially offset the Revlimid loss, the analyst said.        The company also has the recently-acquired nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) portfolio from Haleon plc in Europe, as an additional growth driver.        Natco Pharma has some other key first-to-file products in the pipeline, including Risdiplam Oral Solution for spinal muscular atrophy and breast cancer drug Olaparib, although the timelines for these are yet to be defined.        Analysts are divided on the company’s prospects, though.        “There are products in the pipeline, but there will be a one or two-year gap in between, where the base will be much lower, the profits will be much lower,"" an analyst who requested anonymity told Mint.        In a research note dated 14 February, ICICI Direct analysts said: “We continue to have faith in Natco’s ability to focus on blockbusters which are capable of generating robust cash flows for 3-5 years' horizon before they fade.""

There is no dearth of competition when it comes to Semaglutide, with leading generics makers jumping in. Sun Pharma has already undertaken clinical trials for Semaglutide, while Biocon signed an exclusive licensing and supply agreement for Semaglutide commercialization in Brazil with Biomm last year.        Domestically, innovators Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have also indicated potential launches.

New Study Points to Using Ozempic to Treat Addiction | Psychology Today,https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/navigating-addiction-recovery/202502/new-study-points-to-using-ozempic-to-treat-addiction,"Reviewed by Davia Sills GLP-1 agonist medications such as Ozempic have been game changers in the treatment of obesity and diabetes. Recently, a new study found evidence that Ozempic may be a promising medicine for individuals with alcohol use disorders. This investigation, one of the first clinical trials focused on a population with alcohol use disorders, expands other research exploring the impact of GLP-1 agonists on alcohol and tobacco use among individuals with obesity or diabetes who were being treated with these medications. GLP-1 (also known as glucagon-like peptide 1) is a hormone that is produced by the digestive system and in parts of the brain after we eat. GLP-1 agonist medicines such as Ozempic and Wegovy mimic this hormone’s effects, letting the body know that you’ve eaten enough. The powerful weight loss effects of these medicines have led individuals who take them to achieve a 15 percent reduction in their body weight, on average. Addiction scientists took an interest in GLP-1 agonists after some people who were taking them for weight loss noted that in addition to suppressing their appetite, the medication also seemed to reduce their desire to drink alcohol and/or smoke. Though the reasons these medicines had this effect are not yet well understood, we can make some assumptions based on the way they work on appetite. We know that GLP-1 reduces dopamine (the brain’s pleasure chemical). When a person has food in front of them that they normally really like, such as a piece of cake, without the usual amount of dopamine released, they won’t feel as “excited” in anticipation of enjoying the cake. Without a strong urge, desire, or craving for the cake, they become less likely to want it. If the same process is happening in relation to alcohol and drugs, then GLP-1 agonists may reduce the desire to use them. Research is currently in the early stages. So far, we’ve learned from preliminary study results that those with obesity or diabetes who take GLP-1 agonist medications show reductions in alcohol and tobacco consumption. To date, there have been two randomized clinical trials (this is the “gold standard” type of research study for testing the effectiveness of a drug) evaluating a GLP-1 agonist for treating alcohol use disorder. The first study did not find reductions in heavy alcohol use after 26 weeks of medication treatment, except among those who had both obesity and an alcohol use disorder. The newest study published earlier this month found that among adults with alcohol use disorders, weekly low-dose semaglutide given over 9 weeks effectively reduced alcohol cravings and use when compared to a placebo. Clinical trials evaluating these medicines for tobacco cessation have found mixed results, with one showing positive effects of a GLP-agonist (exenatide) when taken in combination with nicotine replacement therapy and two trials showing no effects. More studies are needed to understand how well these medicines work to reduce alcohol and drug use, for whom they work best, and at what doses. Though more research is needed, the promise of these medicines is important for two reasons: 1. Since GLP-1 agonists act on brain circuits that are generally tied to reward and pleasure, both from food and drugs, it is possible that these medicines may be therapeutic for individuals who are addicted to more than one type of substance (i.e., polysubstance use or addiction). Currently, all the FDA-approved medicines for addictions are for a specific type of substance use disorder, but we don’t have any such options for addictions to multiple substances. 2. The stigma around addiction as a reflection of poor choices or flawed morals remains in our society. The promise of widely used and known medications such as Ozempic as potential treatment options to help people change their use of alcohol and drugs can help shift the conversation about addiction as an illness. This is an essential step towards helping people access much-needed treatments for this condition without shame and stigma as barriers. Based on what is currently known about GLP-1 agonist medications for addiction: 1. Some treatment providers may opt to prescribe them “off-label” to help someone overcome the addiction. Here’s what this means: Though not FDA-approved for this indication, some prescribing healthcare providers may feel that the research to date is compelling enough to warrant the use of these medications to treat addictions. Off-label prescribing is not at all an uncommon practice. The prescriber relies on their clinical judgment, in conjunction with the patient’s willingness to take a medicine that is not FDA-approved for the condition it’s being prescribed for, with a good understanding of the potential risks and benefits of doing so. 2. Research is in the early stages. It is important to be aware of the stage of research we’re currently in with GLP-1 agonists for addiction. With support for accelerated research currently in place from the National Institutes of Health, we are positioned to have scientifically based guidance on their use for addiction treatment a few years from now. In the meantime, we know that these medicines have promise, but we have a limited understanding of their safety, effectiveness, and ideal dosing for individuals with substance use disorders before more randomized clinical trials are conducted. More FDA-approved and unapproved (but promising) medication treatments to address substance misuse and addiction are covered in greater depth in my recently released book, Addiction: What Everyone Needs to Know.","such Sills evidence agonist new new Ozempic new new game new in the evidence of onewsity of dianewtes. new a new by Davia Sills evidence agonist medications for evidence game new found evidence that Ozempic may new a promising medicine for evidence with alcohol use disorders. This investigation, one of the first clinical trials focused on a population with alcohol use disorders, expofs other research exploring the impact of evidence agonists on alcohol of tobacco use among evidence with onewsity or dianewtes who were newing treated with these medications. evidence (also known new glucagon-like peptide 1) is a hormone that is produced by the digestive system of in parts of the brain after we eat. evidence agonist medicines such new Ozempic of Wegovy mimic this hormone’s effects, letting the body know that you’ve eaten enough. The powerful weight loss effects of these medicines new led evidence who take them to achieve a 15 percent reduction in their body weight, on average. Addiction scientists took an interest in evidence agonists after some people who were taking them for weight loss noted that in addition to suppressing their appetite, the medication also seemed to reduce their desire to drink alcohol of/or smoke. Though the renewons these medicines had this effect are not yet well understood, we can make some newsumptions bnewed on the way they work on appetite. We know that evidence reduces dopamine (the brain’s plenewure chemical). When a person hnew food in front of them that they normally really like, such new a piece of cake, without the usual amount of dopamine relenewed, they won’t feel new “excited” in anticipation of enjoying the cake. Without a strong urge, desire, or craving for the cake, they newcome less likely to want it.

The weight-loss drugs being tested in 2025: will they beat Ozempic?,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00376-w,"You can also search for this author in PubMed  Google Scholar An ongoing trial of Zepbound (tirzepatide) is testing effects on heart disease in people with obesity and diabetes.Credit: Shelby Knowles/Bloomberg via Getty As appetite for blockbuster weight-loss drugs grows worldwide, scientists are developing the next crop of medications that, they hope, will improve the performance of these drugs and offer benefits beyond weight loss. “It’s going to be another year where, every week, there’s going to be something really cool,” says Daniel Drucker, an endocrinologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. New obesity definition sidelines BMI to focus on health New obesity definition sidelines BMI to focus on health Drug makers are building on the success of medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy, which contain the active ingredient semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. These drugs mimic the hormone GLP-1, helping to regulate blood-sugar levels and appetite. But most of these medications are costly, require weekly injections and need to be taken long-term to prevent weight regain. These are some of the issues that companies hope alternative drugs will address. Nature looks at the weight-loss medicines being tested in 2025 and what they have to offer. Tirzepatide — sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound and given by injection — mimics GLP-1 and another hormone called gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which is involved in fat metabolism. In trial results published in November, it helped participants to lose up to 20% of their body weight over 72 weeks and reduced the risk of diabetes, compared with a placebo. People taking semaglutide for 68 weeks lose up to 15% of their body weight. Participants who took tirzepatide also had a beneficial reduction in heart weight and in fat surrounding the heart, improved mobility and lower blood pressure and inflammation compared with people on a placebo. One trial expected to conclude in 2025 is examining tirzepatide’s effects on heart disease in people with obesity and diabetes. Retatrutide, which has not yet received regulatory approval for weight loss, activates receptors for GLP-1, GIP and glucagon, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Developed by Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, it has shown even more promising results than tirzepatide and semaglutide, with trial participants losing an average of 24% of their body weight over 11 months. The drug also helped to reduce blood-sugar levels in people with diabetes, and it’s now being tested in phase III trials that are expected to conclude by 2026. Anti-obesity drug has life-changing benefits for arthritis Anti-obesity drug has life-changing benefits for arthritis Researchers are excited about combination therapies such as retatrutide, says Beverly Tchang, an endocrinologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, who notes that obesity’s complexity makes targeting multiple pathways the most promising approach. Orforglipron, an oral small-molecule drug candidate also developed by Eli Lilly, showed similar results to GLP-1 injections in rodents, and led to a weight loss of about 10% over 26 weeks in people with obesity, improving blood pressure and levels of circulating fatty molecules. Like Ozempic, orforglipron is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, but whereas Ozempic requires injection, orforglipron comes as a daily pill. Lilly expects to complete phase III trials in 2025, and orforglipron could receive US regulatory approval in 2026, according to Lilly’s chief executive Dave Ricks. “The wild card is the oral small molecules,” says Randy Seeley, an obesity specialist at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. Many companies are working on this approach, because pills might be more appealing and cost-effective than injections, but progress has been slower than expected owing to dosing challenges, he says. “If one of them finally breaks through, it has the ability to alter the landscape pretty considerably.” Biopharmaceutical company Amgen in Thousand Oaks, California, is planning a phase III trial of its drug candidate MariTide, which activates GLP-1 receptors while reducing GIP’s activity. The medication can be taken monthly by injection and resulted in an average weight loss of up to 20% over 52 weeks, according to data released by the company. Unlike other treatments, MariTide has shown the ability to maintain weight loss for several months after the last dose. When people stop taking semaglutide or tirzepatide, they tend to regain weight quickly, but that doesn’t seem to happen with MariTide, which might encourage more people to have the treatment, says Seeley, who consults for and receives funding from Amgen and other companies developing obesity drugs. or Nature 638, 591-592 (2025) doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-00376-w Reprints and permissions Dozens of new obesity drugs are coming: these are the ones to watch News Feature 12 FEB 25 A comprehensive spatio-cellular map of the human hypothalamus Article 05 FEB 25 Obesity drugs: huge study identifies new health risks News 20 JAN 25 Rare genetic disorder treated in womb for the first time News 20 FEB 25 Plasmodium blood stage development requires the chromatin remodeller Snf2L Article 19 FEB 25 Human-correlated genetic models identify precision therapy for liver cancer Article 19 FEB 25 The School of Science and Engineering (SSE) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen) sincerely invites applications for mul...

"Ozempic, Wegovy Shortage Is Officially Over | MedPage Today",https://www.medpagetoday.com/endocrinology/diabetes/114324,"      Kristen Monaco, Senior Staff Writer, MedPage Today                        February 21, 2025 The shortage of semaglutide injections (Ozempic, Wegovy) is over, the FDA announced on Friday. The agency, along with maker Novo Nordisk, confirmed that supply now meets or exceeds both the current and projected U.S. demand. The injectable formulation of the GLP-1 receptor agonist has been in shortage since August 2022 due to increased demand. ""Patients and prescribers may still see intermittent and limited localized supply disruptions as the products move through the supply chain from the manufacturer and distributors to local pharmacies,"" the FDA noted in a statement. The shortage resolution applies to all strengths of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes, chronic weight management, and major adverse cardiovascular event risk reduction. The FDA said it will give compounders a grace period of 60 to 90 days to finish producing, distributing, and dispensing copies of semaglutide injection products to ""avoid unnecessary disruption to patient treatment."" Compounders are allowed to make copies of a drug only when it's on the FDA shortage list, meaning the demand or projected demand of that drug exceeds the U.S. supply. ""We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand,"" said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations and global business development and president of Novo Nordisk, in a statement. ""No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients,"" he added.

"Understanding Medications for Weight Loss: Ozempic, Wegovy, and More - Endocrinology",https://healthmatters.nyp.org/understanding-medications-for-weight-loss/,"Story By                    Dorothy Cucci Medications for weight loss have soared in popularity since 2017, when Ozempic was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). There are now nine types of FDA-approved GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) agonists — a class of prescription drugs for weight loss. A recent poll found that 1 in 8 U.S. adults had tried or are using GLP-1s. Scientists are also finding new uses for the breakthrough weight-loss drugs, which were originally designed for diabetic and medically overweight patients. Recently, the FDA announced Ozempic can be used to reduce the risk of chronic kidney disease. Wegovy won FDA approval to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, or cardiovascular death, and Zepbound recently became the first drug approved for obstructive sleep apnea. Research is still early, but the medications may eventually be used for a host of other medical conditions. A new, large-scale study published in the journal Nature Medicine reported that Ozempic and similar medications for weight loss may lower risk of 42 health conditions, including Alzheimer’s, substance use disorders, and mental health conditions. “Weight affects so many chronic medical conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol, fatty liver, and certain cancers — as well as issues like sleep apnea and osteoarthritis,” says Dr. Mohini Aras, an obesity medicine specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. “Our goal with weight loss is to improve these conditions, and even a modest weight loss of 5% to 10% can make a difference.” Dr. Aras spoke with Health Matters about how drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy work, who should (and shouldn’t) take them, and their risks and side effects. Dr. Mohini Aras How do medications for weight loss work?Dr. Aras: First, it’s important to understand that our brain is designed to defend against starvation and retain our weight. When we lose weight, naturally occurring hormones send a message to our brain to increase hunger and cravings and slow our metabolism down. Our brain even makes our muscles more efficient, so we don’t burn as many calories with the same activity; this is a starvation response. As a result, people tend to yo-yo: They will lose, regain, lose, and regain weight. Medications for weight loss activate the hormones that we naturally produce to regulate weight. These medications target appetite and hunger, helping people feel full sooner and stay full longer. They may also impact cravings, thoughts of food, and binge eating. The first anti-obesity medicines were stimulants that were approved in the late 1950s, and we’ve seen a lot of advances in the field of obesity medicine in the last 10 years. How are these medicines taken?Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound (which all contain the active ingredient semaglutide) are once-weekly injectable medications. They come as a pen, and you do the injection yourself at home. It’s a subcutaneous injection, so you can do it in your upper thigh, in your abdomen, or in your arm, and it’s a tiny needle that is just enough to poke the skin — so it’s not too bothersome for people. An oral version, Rybelsus (which contains the active ingredient tirzepatide), is taken once a day, typically on an empty stomach when you first wake up. The pills are easier to transport, as opposed to the injectables, which have specific temperature requirements. Both Ozempic and Wegovy may also soon be available in the form of a daily pill, and two recent studies showed that the oral versions are about as effective as the injectables. How can you get a prescription?We require a comprehensive medical evaluation, including labs, vitals, and a full medical history. We tailor individual plans for patients, with the foundation being diet and physical activity, and select appropriate weight loss medications that can help support the hard work that they are doing. We also have a team of providers, including registered dieticians, nurse practitioners, and physicians, who aid patients in achieving their health goals. Patients who have histories of gallbladder disease, pancreatitis, or family histories of medullary thyroid cancer or rare disorders of the endocrine system may not be eligible. How much do they cost?These medicines are quite expensive if they’re not covered by insurance — from $900 to $1,400 a month. We have an entire pharmacy team dedicated to processing the authorizations required by insurances to try to obtain these medications for our patients. Obesity is chronic, so when we start a medication, we have to plan for it long-term. Given the cost of being on these medications, most of my patients wouldn’t be able to afford these drugs without insurance coverage. Can these medications also help with addiction?Medications for weight loss improve satiety and reduce cravings. Clinically, many patients do report a reduction in their interest in alcohol — and that’s a type of craving. It’s important to remember that these medicines work while you take them, so the benefit of reduced cravings won’t persist once the medicine is no longer circulating in your body. How long do patients have to remain on weight-loss medication?Obesity and type 2 diabetes are chronic medical conditions that require long-term management. I tell my patients to plan for long-term use, which is why cost is important to discuss up front. What are the side effects of taking medications for weight loss?These drugs directly act on the gastrointestinal system. One of the ways they work is by slowing the gastric emptying, so the food sits in your stomach longer before it goes into your intestines. That’s how it can make people feel full sooner and stay full longer, but that’s where the side effects come in as well — because food’s sitting there, it can cause some reflux, nausea, a sense of overfullness, diarrhea, or constipation. The injectable medicines are most potent the first few days after the injection, and that’s when the side effects can be most prominent. In general, we start with the lowest dose and gradually escalate as needed; we always want to use the least amount of medicine possible to facilitate weight loss. I’ve seen a common misconception that the side effects of drugs like Ozempic are horrible, but, for the most part, that’s not been my clinical experience. The gastric slowing is something that is known about this class of medications and contributes to the gastrointestinal side effects, but for the vast majority of people, they are able to tolerate the medications well. It’s important to reduce portions and eat slowly to mitigate side effects. Our practice at the Comprehensive Weight Control Center has used these medicines for a long time; we have a lot of tips and tricks that make them more tolerable for patients who are sensitive to the side effects. What would you say to patients who are interested in these drugs but may be feeling ashamed to ask about them?Physicians have failed people who struggle with weight for decades. We have told them to eat less and exercise more, and now we know that’s not sufficient for the vast majority of people. Obesity is a chronic disease with several root causes that requires medical management. I would encourage patients to seek more information to understand if they would be good candidates for these medications.

The Ozempic Shortage Is Over | WIRED,https://www.wired.com/story/end-of-semaglutide-shortage-glp1-ozempic-wegovy/,"The US Food and Drug Administration has determined that semaglutide is no longer in shortage, a move that will have implications for patients taking cheaper, compounded versions of the drug. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss medications Ozempic and Wegovy, has been on the FDA’s shortage list since March 2022. Supply could not keep pace with fervent demand for the drug, which reached such dizzying levels of popularity that it transformed Novo Nordisk into one of the world’s most valuable companies, with a market capitalization larger than the rest of the economy of its home nation of Denmark. In the intervening years, a lucrative industry of telehealth companies, medical spas, and pharmacies making and selling “compounded” copies of the medications has arisen. These off-brand copies are sold at a steep discount—sometimes under $100 a vial—compared to the name-brand medications, which can be over $1,000 a month without insurance. At the end of October, the FDA changed the status of all dosages of Ozempic and Wegovy to “available,” signaling that the end of the official shortage was likely in sight. It took until today, nearly four months later, for regulators to conclude that the drug was widely available enough to remove it from the shortage list. The FDA is giving “503A” compounders, typically state-licensed pharmacies or physician compounders that run smaller operations, until April 22 to cease producing the drug. It is giving “503B” compounders, which are larger outsourcing facilities that follow stricter manufacturing guidelines, until May 22. Under ordinary circumstances, it’s not especially contentious when drugs come off a shortage list. But there is reason to believe that players within this industry will push back on this announcement. Drug compounding is a well-established practice; pharmacists are permitted to make copies of medications when there’s a drug shortage or when patients need versions made in specific dosages or without allergens. But the GLP-1 boom has created an opportunity for compounders that has transformed pockets of the industry, with compounding pharmacies producing off-brand duplicates for likely millions of patients. Robert MacArthur, director of pharmacy at the Rockefeller University Hospital, says that once a drug comes off the FDA shortage list, outsourcing pharmacies that make large batches of compounded drugs for health care facilities are not supposed to compound that drug anymore. But for smaller, traditional compounding pharmacies that make drugs for home use, it’s a legal gray area. “They can compound it if the physician writes the prescription for an individual patient and feels there’s some compelling reason why that given patient needs that special compounded product,” MacArthur says. That reason could be adjusting the dose or tailoring the medication to a specific patient. Some telehealth outfits have signaled their intention to continue offering their products.“Now that the FDA has determined the drug shortage for semaglutide has been resolved, we will continue to offer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law to meet patient needs,” Andrew Dudum, founder and CEO of Hims & Hers Health, wrote on X, adding that the company is closely monitoring potential future shortages. In December, the FDA declared that tirzepatide, the other popular GLP-1 drug, was no longer in shortage. The small 503A compounders had 60 days to stop production, while the larger 503B outsourcing facilities had 90 days to wrap up sales. Eli Lilly, which sells tirzepatide under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound, sent a flurry of cease-and-desist letters to hundreds of companies selling compounded versions. The compounding industry pushed back, with a trade group filing a lawsuit against the FDA, arguing that the drug was actually still hard to access for patients. As of now, the FDA has set deadlines for compounders to stop producing tirzepatide products, but it is not enforcing the deadlines at the moment as the lawsuit is ongoing. Novo Nordisk has already attempted to curb the compounded semaglutide market. It has filed over 50 lawsuits against compounders, telehealth clinics, and medspas, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. More recently, it has petitioned the FDA to block production of compounded semaglutide by placing the ingredient on the “Demonstrable Difficulties for Compounding” list, which excludes drugs that are too difficult to compound safely. “We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand. No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients,” Novo Nordisk executive Dave Moore said in a statement. (The FDA does not evaluate compounded medications for safety, quality, or efficacy before they are sold.) “I think the compounders have a real valid argument,” MacArthur says. “This is a drug that is going to prolong people’s lives and meaningfully increase the quality of their life. You’ve already got a whole population of compounders out there that are making it, the product quality is adequate, people are using it, and then you’re suddenly going to take it away? I mean, I think that that would create a public uproar.” Updated: 2/21/2024, 2:29 pm EST: This story was updated to quote from a post from the founder and CEO of Hims & Hers Health.","been Food US shortage, Food shortage, Food that semaglutide that will no shortage, Food a shortage, Food that shortage, Food have been Food shortage, Food of no longer in shortage, a Semaglutide, the active that will US move that will have that will been semaglutide that will no in move that will Nordthat willk’s blockbuster diabetes US weight-loss medications Ozempic US Wegovy, a move that will have been on the FDA’s shortage lthat willt since shortage, Food Supply could not keep pace with fervent demUS for the drug, which reached such dizzying levels of popularity that it transformed move that will Nordthat willk into one of the world’s most valuable companies, with a market capitalization larger than the rest of the economy of its home nation of Denmark.

"Ozempic and Wegovy are no longer in shortage, FDA says | CNN",https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/health/ozempic-wegovy-shortage-over-fda-says/index.html,"Blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic are no longer in shortage, the US Food and Drug Administration said on Friday. The update about the popular semaglutide injections from drug manufacturer Novo Nordisk follows just two months after the FDA said that shortages of tirzepatide injections Zepbound and Mounjaro from competitor Eli Lilly had also ended. “We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand,” Dave Moore, president of Novo Nordisk Inc., said in a statement Friday. Related article Ozempic shown to reduce drinking in first trial in alcohol-use disorder GLP-1 drugs had been in shortage since 2022 due to increased demand, and a law allowed compounding pharmacies to step in to fill supply gaps during those years. Compounded drugs use the same active ingredients but are made by pharmacies or manufacturers other than the companies that make FDA-approved versions of the medicines. This enabled thousands, or even millions, of people to access costly GLP-1 medicines at a lower price point. The end of the shortage would effectively bar the sale of compounded versions of the drugs, but the FDA said that they do not plan to take any action against compounding pharmacies for 60 to 90 days. “Patients and prescribers may still see intermittent and limited localized supply disruptions as the products move through the supply chain from the manufacturer and distributors to local pharmacies,” the FDA said on Friday. The FDA announced a similar policy for pharmacies making tirzepatide compounds when that shortage was resolved in December. In August, drug manufacturer Eli Lilly began sending cease-and-desist letters to telehealth companies, wellness centers and medical spas selling compounded versions of Zepbound and Mounjaro, according to Reuters. The company has also filed lawsuits against sellers falsely claiming to sell FDA-approved versions of the drug. Related article What you should know about carbonated water and weight loss On Friday, drug manufacturer Novo Nordisk warned in a news release that the “FDA’s decision means that making or selling a knockoff compounded drug that is essentially a copy of Ozempic or Wegovy is illegal.” The company has already filed more than 100 lawsuits related to “copycat” semaglutide products, most under claims of false advertising or deceptive and unfair trade practices. “No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients,” company president Moore said in a statement Friday. The FDA has issued safety warnings about some compounded versions of semaglutide. The agency said that it received reports of adverse events in people who used compounded semaglutide and that patients “should not use a compounded drug if an approved drug is available.” But the Outsourcing Facilities Association, a trade group representing companies that make certain compounded medications, has sued the FDA over its removal of tirzepatide from the shortage list claiming that it happened “without notice, without soliciting input from affected parties and the public, and without meaningful rationale.” Olympia Pharmaceuticals says that they provide compounded GLP-1 medications – the vast majority of which are semaglutide – to tens of thousands of patients each week, and there hasn’t been sufficient reassurance for prescribers to feel confident that supply is strong enough to meet demand. “Our biggest concern would be that patient continuity of care.

"FDA ends semaglutide shortage, closing the door on compounded Wegovy, Ozempic",https://cardiovascularbusiness.com/topics/clinical/pharmaceutics/fda-ends-semaglutide-shortage-wegovy-ozempic,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced that a years-long shortage of Wegovy and Ozempic, two popular prescription-only semaglutide injections, is officially over. They have both been removed from the FDA’s drug shortage list after first landing there back in 2022. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist being sold by Novo Nordisk under the brand names Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus. GLP-1 receptor agonists were originally developed to treat diabetes, but they are being used more and more to help obese and overweight patients lose weight. In addition, semaglutide has specifically been linked to consistent health benefits for heart failure patients and patients undergoing heart bypass surgery. While semaglutide was on the drug shortage list, outsourcing facilities had a green light to produce their own “essential copy” versions of Wegovy and Ozempic. Compounded drugs are not technically approved by the FDA, though they are still required to meet certain conditions predetermined by the FDA. Now, however, those compounded versions will no longer be legal. “We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand,” said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations and global business development and president of Novo Nordisk, said in a statement. “No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients. Patient safety remains our top priority and, in line with our purpose to improve lives and health, we continue to partner, educate, and advocate for expanded, affordable access to our medicines for those who need and rely on them.” Novo Nordisk is now producing these drugs around the clock, seven days a week. In addition, the company added, billions of dollars have been invested in expanding its manufacturing facilities. Michael has more than 18 years of experience as a professional writer and editor.

Ozempic Literally Came From a Monster – And It's Not Alone,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ozempic-literally-came-monster-not-032842533.html,"The toxic bite of a Gila monster can kill a human, but a specific ingredient in the cocktail of the lizard's venom is the reason we have glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) agonists like Ozempic and Wegovy. At the end of the 20th century, endocrinologist Daniel Drucker was looking for a hormone similar enough to the human gut's GLP-1, which would have similar appetite-suppressing and blood sugar-regulating qualities, without being broken down by the human body so quickly. Drucker had read about the work of endocrinologist John Eng, gastroenterologist Jean-Pierre Raufman and biochemist John Pisano, who had sequenced the proteins in Gila monster  (Heloderma suspectum) venom and found two that looked like human GLP-1. Drucker and his team from the University of Toronto acquired a Gila monster from the Utah Zoo's breeding program to dissect for further research. This work confirmed that the lizard species' unique genes produce a protein, Exendin-4, that fit the bill, mimicking GLP-1 while hanging round in the human body for far longer. A synthetic version was created in the years after, but it took until 2005 for this GLP-1 agonist to become an FDA-approved treatment for type 2 diabetes. It's now also become a popular treatment for obesity, with further potential applications on the horizon. This isn't the only time we've relied on the chemical arsenal of toxic animals. Life-saving drugs have emerged from the crucible of the natural world many times throughout history. One of the top-selling drugs worldwide originates, ironically, from a snake's venom – but it's far from 'snake oil'. Lisinopril reduces the chemicals that constrict blood flow, which is why it's prescribed for high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, and to heart attack survivors. But the maker of its natural form, the Brazilian viper (Bothrops jararaca), evolved to produce enzyme inhibitors that help venom spread smoothly through the doomed body of its prey. Sea sponges are among the most ancient animals on this planet, so they've had a long time to cook up some interesting molecules. The Caribbean sponge (Tectitethya crypta) produces strange nucleosides which, in lieu of an immune system, protect it from the onslaught of foreign DNA introduced to its sessile body by predators and prey as it filter feeds. These nucleosides provided the inspiration for the chemotherapy drug cytarabine, which is among the WHO's List of Essential Medicines for its use in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia. Animal toxins are proving useful in treating other cancers, too. In 2004, oncologist Jim Olson was dismayed to discover that even after a 14-hour surgery to remove a tumor from a teenage girl's brain, a thumb-sized piece of the cancer had been left behind. He assembled a team to find a molecule that would help surgeons see cancers with the naked eye, and thanks to newly assembled DNA databases, they were able to find a suitable candidate in a matter of weeks. Its unlikely origin? The venom of one of the most dangerous scorpions on Earth, the deathstalker (Leiurus quinquestriatus). In isolation, the peptide chlorotoxin Cy5.5 had already been found to bind to ion channels on brain tumor cells, but not to normal human cells. The lab-made version, Tozuleristide, creates a kind of light-up 'paint' under near-infrared that has allowed researchers to see cancerous clusters as small as a few hundred cells in rodent studies. From GLP-1 agonists to chemotherapy treatments, it's incredible that the toxic potions brewed up by the animal kingdom can be used to improve and save human lives. And a humbling reminder that the answers to our problems may be found in unexpected places, if we are willing to look further afield, and of course, if those species and their habitats still exist by the time we get there.

The Ozempic weight loss drug shortage is over,https://qz.com/fda-ozempic-wegovy-shortage-resolved-1851765844,"The shortage of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+5.33%) blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs is officially over, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA updated its drug shortage database on Friday, marking the shortage of semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — as resolved. The news puts pressure on companies that have been able to sell off-brand, also known as compounded versions, of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs due to widespread shortages. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, have become highly sought after for their weight loss effects. Soaring sales for these treatments have transformed Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+0.44%), the maker of competing drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. However, Skyrocketing demand and the drugs’ high list price has made it difficult for some patients to fill their prescriptions. Semaglutide had been listed on the FDA shortage list since March 2022. “We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand,” said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients.” Novo Nordisk stock jumped over 4% on Friday. The millennial-focused telehealth platform Hims & Hers (HIMS-24.45%), which began offering a compounded version of semaglutide last May, saw its stock drop by over 22% during Friday’s trading session. Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the FDA to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand name weight-loss drugs has spurred several digital healthcare companies to take advantage of that provision. “Now that the FDA has determined the drug shortage for semaglutide has been resolved, we will continue to offer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law to meet patient needs,” Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum said in a statement. “We’re also closely monitoring potential future shortages, as Novo Nordisk stated two weeks ago that it would continue to have ‘capacity limitations’ and ‘expected continued periodic supply constraints and related drug shortage notifications.’” In July, the company added Kåre Schultz, a longtime Novo Nordisk executive, to its board of directors. At the time, Schultz told Bloomberg that the company has a “long future” in selling compounded semaglutide. When asked if pharmacies will still be able to make compounded semaglutide after the shortages end, Schulz said he wasn’t worried because there would still be cases where patients need individualized prescriptions. The FDA said on Friday that state-licensed pharmacies and physicians, known as 503A compounders, must stop making and distributing semaglutide products by April 22. Outsourcing facilities, known as 503B’s, have until May 22 to do the same. However, the FDA’s decision will likely face challenges from compounders, who have already sued the agency over its decision to declare a shortage of another weight-loss drug as resolved. The FDA originally declared the shortage of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound — over in October. However, an industry group, the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA), filed a lawsuit in Texas against the agency just days later, challenging its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed. In its lawsuit, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary,” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” The FDA said, in a court filing, that pharmacists could temporarily resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision In a December letter, the agency stated that its review found Eli Lilly has sufficient supply to meet and exceed both current and future demand for the drugs. As a result, it set deadlines for compounding pharmacies — Feb. 18 for 503As and Mar. 19 for 503B’s — to stop selling off-brand versions of tirzepatide.

The FDA said it does not intend to take action against 503B drug compounders for 90 days, or until May 22, “to avoid unnecessary disruption to patient treatment.” Hims & Hers Chief Executive Officer Andrew Dudum said Friday in a post on X that Hers company ""will continue to Picture Picture Alliancefer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law,"" adding that Hers company is ""closely monitoring potential future shortages.""

Hotdogs and motorways: The ripples created by Denmark's Ozempic and Wegovy boom,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20250220-hotdogs-and-motorways-the-ripples-created-by-denmarks-ozempic-and-wegovy-boom,"American demand for weight-loss drugs is supercharging Denmark’s economy and transforming a small Danish community into an unlikely boomtown. Look back only two years ago and the name of Danish firm Novo Nordisk would hardly ring a bell. But now, soaring sales of two blockbuster drugs, the anti-obesity and diabetes treatments Wegovy and Ozempic, have turned this pharmaceutical giant into one of Europe's most valuable companies. The drugmaker revealed in early February 2025 that its pre-tax profits jumped 22% to $17.8bn (DKK127.2bn/£14.2bn). It has also given Denmark's economy a huge boost, making it one of the region's fastest-growing. From new job creation to lower mortgage rates, the ripple effects of skyrocketing drug demand have been felt across the country, and not least in the tiny port town of Kalundborg, a community of fewer than 17,000 residents, where one of the biggest investments in Danish history is now underway. Stepping off the train on the outskirts of Kalundborg, an hour northwest of Copenhagen, passengers are greeted by birdsong and construction noise. It's an unlikely spot for what is now the epicentre of a global weight-loss revolution. Across a railway bridge stand the grey, boxy buildings of Novo Nordisk's sprawling industrial site. This is where half of the world's insulin is made. It's also where semaglutide is produced, the game-changing active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. ""We are the centre of where the medicine starts, the core substance,"" Kalundborg's mayor Martin Damm told me, as we toured the plant's perimeter, a vast site covering 1.6 million sq m, equivalent to the size of 224 football pitches. ""Now you're coming into crane land,"" announces Damm. I quickly counted about 20 of them towering over new concrete structures and temporary cabins. An eye watering $8.6bn (DKK60bn) will be spent here over the next few years, which will see 1,250 new jobs added to the plant's 4,400-strong workforce. It's also brought 3,000 construction workers to the area. ""We have a rule of thumb, when you have one job inside the industry, that will generate three jobs outside,"" stated Damm. Kalundborg's economy has seen ups and downs. Once a shipbuilding centre, it then boomed in the 1960s manufacturing Carmen Curlers, a hair roller that was popular in the US until fashions changed. Now it's seemingly on a roll again. As we drive by, Damm points out a petrol station. ""Every morning the owner needs to roast 30kg (66lbs) of pork to make sandwiches. All these craftsmen like pork sandwiches."" There are more boom stories: a local supermarket has seen sales increase five-fold and a fast food store sold 17,500 hot dogs in little over a month to hungry construction workers seeking an easy lunch. Two-thirds of Denmark's GDP growth came from just four boroughs. All share one thing in common: they're where Novo Nordisk premises are located. Among them Kalundborg saw a staggering 27% growth rate in 2022, according to the most recent data available. ""We were number one,"" says Damm, adding that unemployment in the area, once high a decade ago, is now among the region's lowest. Novo Nordisk's swelling corporate tax bill has lifted the municipality's finances, which has splashed out on a public swimming area, and plans for a new culture house and library. More than 1,250 homes will be built, and ground has been broken for a new motorway to Copenhagen. Yet despite this income, local primary schools lag behind on subjects like maths, and the area has a higher rate of overweight children, prompting some criticism. Speaking to the BBC, locals in Kalundborg were measured about seeing the benefits just yet. ""Businesses opening and closing, that's the same,"" says Lonny Frederiksen, who runs a hair salon in the town. ""But young people have more opportunities today."" Many workers commute rather than living in Kalundborg, adds customer Gitte Pedersen, while lamenting the heavy traffic. ""Sometimes I have to wait [because of the] queues and I don't like that."" But she's optimistic about the town's future, ""It will bring a lot of jobs. In a few years we'll see the difference."" For a century Novo Nordisk's business was built on making insulin, but the discovery of semaglutide's weight-loss effect, marked a turning point. ""It is really transforming into a new firm,"" says Kurt Jacobsen, a professor at Copenhagen Business School, who's authored a book on the company. Wegovy and Ozempic belong to a class of drugs called GLP-1s, that help control blood sugar and suppress appetite. Ozempic got US approval in 2017, followed in 2021 by Wegovy, which is now available in thirteen countries, including China. Sales of the weekly weight-loss jab grew 86 percent last year, while Ozempic is the world's biggest-selling diabetes medicine, and 45 million people now use the firm's treatments. More than half of Novo Nordisk's sales were in the United States, where tens of thousands of new Wegovy users have signed up weekly for prescriptions. There it costs more than $1,000 (£746, €958) a month, compared to only $92 (£73/€88) in Germany, and many insurers refuse to cover it. During a congressional hearing last year, Senator Bernie Sanders repeatedly asked Novo Nordisk's chief executive officer Lars Frugaard Jørgensen why Americans pay more, demanding the company ""Stop ripping us off!"" In response, the firm blamed the complexities and ""middlemen"" of the American healthcare system. Worldwide around 800 million people live with obesity, and it's estimated the market for weight-loss treatments could be worth $150bn (£144bn) globally by 2030. That's fuelling an industry-wide gold rush as big Pharma search for the next generation of anti-obesity drugs. Novo Nordisk and American rival Eli Lilly, which produces similar medications, lead the pack for now, but both drugmakers have struggled to keep up with the insatiable demand. To boost manufacturing capacity, Novo Nordisk has embarked on a colossal spending spree costing several billion dollars. It's enlarging factories at home and adding a new plant, while beyond Danish shores, sites in France and the US are being expanded, and it bought three drug-making facilities from American firm Catulent. For a company with its headquarters in a small nation with less than six million people, Novo Nordisk's rise has had an outsized impact. ""There are other companies that also play a big role in the economy, Maersk especially, but nothing on this scale,"" says Las Olsen, chief economist at Danske Bank. ""This is the largest ever."" In 2023 Denmark ranked among Europe's fastest-growing economies, as GDP expanded by 2.5%, and half of that was driven by the pharmaceutical sector. After a big boost from drug exports, the government now anticipates that growth in 2024 was 3.0% and will be 2.9% this year. It's also the country's largest taxpayer, and accounted for a fifth of all new jobs, while many Danes and pension funds hold shares. ""In a way Denmark is like the rest Europe, but a little stronger. Then with Novo Nordisk on top, we're a lot stronger,' says Olsen. Dollars flooding into Denmark from overseas sales have put pressure on the krone. The knock-on effect is lower borrowing costs. ""We have slightly lower interest rates than the euro area, which is a very direct result of all this money inflow,"" explains Olsen. More like this: Conversely, in recent months, the firm's previously sky-high stock price has been hammered, after trial results for two new anti-obesity treatments disappointed investors. It prompted a sell-off so huge that Denmark's currency briefly weakened. However, successful early trial data for another new weekly jab saw shares swing up again in January. And there are concerns that Novo Nordisk is outgrowingDenmark and could make the economy more vulnerable. Comparisons have been drawn with Finland, where the economy slumped in 2007, as mobile giant Nokia failed to compete with new smartphones. But most experts here aren't too worried about a similar outcome. ""Most would agree that there is a low probability,"" says Carl-Johan Dalgaard, chair of Denmark's Economic Council. ""Of course, the probability is not zero.  If you have an economy that harbours industrial superstars most would find it a big plus."" However when a few large firms dominate a country's economy – and that's increasingly the picture in Denmark – there can be other drawbacks, suggests Dalgaard. ""There's a worry that with economic influence, you might also eventually see political influence emerging, which could have policy consequences."" But there are new risks on the horizon. Amid tensions over the control of Greenland, US President Donald Trump has threatened potential tariffs on Danish goods, and Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen recently summoned leaders of the country's biggest companies for a meeting. ""It has been hinted at from the US side that there may unfortunately be a situation where we work less together than we do today,"" says Frederiksen. Among those present was Novo Nordisk's Jørgensen, and following the company's earnings announcement on 5 February 2025, he told reporters the business was well-prepared, but ""not immune"". ""Tariffs are always a bad idea,"" says Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. However he reckons, ""Of all the countries in the EU, nobody would be more resilient to US tariffs than arguably Denmark. A company as sophisticated as Novo Nordisk (which also has production outside Denmark) would be able to insulate themselves."" Besides Novo Nordisk, a string of large international businesses have emerged from Denmark including shipping giant Maersk, brewer Carlsberg and toymaker Lego. Many are partly owned by charitable foundations. The model gives longer-term stability and prevents firms being easily broken up, says Mette Feifer, vice president of the Danish Chamber of Commerce. ""If Novo Nordisk were not owned by a foundation, I don't think it would be Danish at this moment. It would have been sold 10 or 20 years back."" The company's philanthropic foundation is now the world's richest, and in 2023 it showered $1.3bn (£1bn/DKK9.1bn) in grants on hundreds of projects, in Denmark and beyond. Back in Kalundborg a new educational campus has sprung up training the next generation of life sciences workers. Among several institutions, Helix Lab is financed by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, and gives Masters students access to research labs and placements with local biotech firms. ""You have the industry right across the street, and you can collaborate more closely with them,"" says Maria Riquelme Jimenez, a chemical engineering student from Mexico, who hopes to eventually find work with Novo Nordisk. ""It really gives them an advantage for future jobs,"" adds Anette Birck, director of Helix Lab. It's also helping to attract talent and providing opportunities for Kalundborg's youth, she says. Overlooking the town's smart waterfront sits Costa Kalundborg Kaffe, owned by New Zealander Shaun Gamble. ""Driving through the building area, you just get surprised how massive it is for a small town,"" he says. His coffee shop has seen a pick-up in customers and he's noticed more international students moving to the area, as well as local businesses opening up. ""There has been a change. It's still in its infancy, but I can feel it,"" he said. ""In five years, it'll be totally different here – in a good way."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss

Ozempic Literally Came From a Monster – And It's Not Alone : ScienceAlert,https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-literally-came-from-a-monster-and-its-not-alone,"The toxic bite of a Gila monster can kill a human, but a specific ingredient in the cocktail of the lizard's venom is the reason we have glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) agonists like Ozempic and Wegovy. At the end of the 20th century, endocrinologist Daniel Drucker was looking for a hormone similar enough to the human gut's GLP-1, which would have similar appetite-suppressing and blood sugar-regulating qualities, without being broken down by the human body so quickly. Drucker had read about the work of endocrinologist John Eng, gastroenterologist Jean-Pierre Raufman and biochemist John Pisano, who had sequenced the proteins in Gila monster  (Heloderma suspectum) venom and found two that looked like human GLP-1. Drucker and his team from the University of Toronto acquired a Gila monster from the Utah Zoo's breeding program to dissect for further research. This work confirmed that the lizard species' unique genes produce a protein, Exendin-4, that fit the bill, mimicking GLP-1 while hanging round in the human body for far longer. A synthetic version was created in the years after, but it took until 2005 for this GLP-1 agonist to become an FDA-approved treatment for type 2 diabetes. It's now also become a popular treatment for obesity, with further potential applications on the horizon. This isn't the only time we've relied on the chemical arsenal of toxic animals. Life-saving drugs have emerged from the crucible of the natural world many times throughout history. One of the top-selling drugs worldwide originates, ironically, from a snake's venom – but it's far from 'snake oil'. Lisinopril reduces the chemicals that constrict blood flow, which is why it's prescribed for high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, and to heart attack survivors. But the maker of its natural form, the Brazilian viper (Bothrops jararaca), evolved to produce enzyme inhibitors that help venom spread smoothly through the doomed body of its prey. Sea sponges are among the most ancient animals on this planet, so they've had a long time to cook up some interesting molecules. The Caribbean sponge (Tectitethya crypta) produces strange nucleosides which, in lieu of an immune system, protect it from the onslaught of foreign DNA introduced to its sessile body by predators and prey as it filter feeds. These nucleosides provided the inspiration for the chemotherapy drug cytarabine, which is among the WHO's List of Essential Medicines for its use in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia. Animal toxins are proving useful in treating other cancers, too. In 2004, oncologist Jim Olson was dismayed to discover that even after a 14-hour surgery to remove a tumor from a teenage girl's brain, a thumb-sized piece of the  cancer had been left behind. He assembled a team to find a molecule that would help surgeons see cancers with the naked eye, and thanks to newly assembled DNA databases, they were able to find a suitable candidate in a matter of weeks. Its unlikely origin? The venom of one of the most dangerous scorpions on Earth, the deathstalker (Leiurus quinquestriatus). In isolation, the peptide chlorotoxin Cy5.5 had already been found to bind to ion channels on brain tumor cells, but not to normal human cells. The lab-made version, Tozuleristide, creates a kind of light-up 'paint' under near-infrared that has allowed researchers to see cancerous clusters as small as a few hundred cells in rodent studies. From GLP-1 agonists to chemotherapy treatments, it's incredible that the toxic potions brewed up by the animal kingdom can be used to improve and save human lives. And a humbling reminder that the answers to our problems may be found in unexpected places, if we are willing to look further afield, and of course, if those species and their habitats still exist by the time we get there.

Anupam Mittal senses ‘multi-trillion-dollar opportunity’ as Shark Tank India founders pitch Ozempic competitor pill | Television News - The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/shark-tank-india-4-ozempic-competition-moderate-anupam-mittal-multi-trillion-dollar-9845860/,"Shark Tank India, which is currently streaming its fourth season on SonyLIV, recently saw a team of entrepreneurs from Hyderabad, who pitched a product that promises to address the issues of diabetes and obesity. Sreeram Reddy Vanga, Kartikeya Kabra and Dr Lalitha Palle, the founders of the brand Moderate, said that their products can be consumed in the form of pills. They claimed that their pills can reduce 40 percent carbohydrates and associated calories from meals, and reduce post-meal spikes in sugar levels. The ‘sharks’ were quite skeptical about the products. The founders asked for Rs 50 lakh for 1.25 percent of the company, valuing it at Rs 40 crore. At the beginning of the pitch, Vineeta Singh said that she was quite impressed with their packaging but admitted that she was scared of trying the product. “Darr lag raha hai par fir bhi mann kar raha hai khane ka (I am scared but I still want to try it),” she said. Anupam Mittal then jumped into the conversation, and questioned the founders about their clinical trials, which they claimed to have spent Rs 50 lakh on. When Peyush Bansal asked them about the side-effects, Dr Lalitha said that 20 percent users might experience some discomfort in their gut during the first couple of days but they will get used to it soon after that. When Anupam brought up Apple Cider Vinegar, which promises similar results, the founders claimed that their product was better, even though they didn’t have much evidence to support that claim. Kunal Bahl also entered the conversation and brought up the “Ozempic revolution,” and asked the founders if they were “ready for the scrutiny” that comes with selling the product to masses who might be extremely skeptical about it. Anupam said that if their product actually does what they claim, then it could be a “multi-trillion dollar opportunity.” ALSO READ | Anupam Mittal suspects a scam after discovering Shark Tank India pitcher is sitting on Rs 100 crore wealth, loses patience after being ignored The founders said that they have sold Rs 1 crore worth of products in the last nine months and claimed that they will be able to generate Rs 6 crore revenue by the end of the year. They also claimed that they had a repeat rate of 33 percent.  Vineeta said that she wasn’t interested in making an offer as she believes that people would be scared of trying the product because of the unknown side effects, and no amount of advertising on social media will be able to solve this problem. Even Peyush backed out after saying that in case something unfortunate happens to a customer, it would weigh heavily on his conscience. He said, “Kisiko kuch ho gaya khuda na khasta main apne ko kabhi maaf nahi kar paunga (God forbid, if something happens to someone, I will not be able to forgive myself.)” Anupam also backed out of the deal after telling the founders that they should arrange third-party clinical trials to prove the efficacy of their products. Kunal gave them an offer of Rs 1 crore for 5 percent of the company, and Aman made then an offer for Rs 50 lakh for 2.5 percent. The founders made a counter offer and the deal was ultimately locked with Kunal and Aman at Rs 1 crore for 5 percent of the company.

FDA removes semaglutide from drug shortage list,https://www.healio.com/news/endocrinology/20250221/fda-removes-semaglutide-from-drug-shortage-list,"The FDA has removed semaglutide from its drug shortage list after the agency determined the current supply of the drug can meet present and future demand, Novo Nordisk and the FDA announced. On Feb. 21, the FDA updated its drug shortage list and labeled the shortage of all doses of injectable semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) as being resolved. The update was confirmed in a press release by Novo Nordisk, which stated the company continues to ship all doses of semaglutide regularly to wholesalers following investments to increase its manufacturing capacity. “We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand,” Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations and global business development and president of Novo Nordisk, said in the release. “No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knock-off drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients. Patient safety remains our top priority and, in line with our purpose to improve lives and health, we continue to partner, educate, and advocate for expanded, affordable access to our medicines for those who need and rely on them."" As Healio previously reported, semaglutide was added to the FDA shortage list in early 2022. Its placement on the drug shortage list allowed compounding pharmacies to manufacture semaglutide, as the FDA did not consider the drug to be “commercially available” in the U.S. The FDA announced it will allow companies to continue dispensing compounded semaglutide for up to 90 more days. State-licensed pharmacies and physicians compounded under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act can continue compounded and distributing semaglutide until April 22, and outsourcing facilities under section 503B of the law are permitted to dispense compounded semaglutide until May 22. The agency stated the deadlines were set “to avoid unnecessary disruption to patient treatment.” Semaglutide’s removal from the drug shortage list comes about 2 months after the FDA also confirmed that the shortage of tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound, Eli Lilly), another incretin-based drug for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity, was resolved. As part of that announcement, the FDA stated it would continue to allow compounded forms of the drug to be manufactured or distributed by state-licensed pharmacies through Feb. 18 and by outsourcing facilities through March 19. During the shortage, the FDA has issued multiple warnings about using off-brand semaglutide. In December 2023, the FDA announced counterfeit forms of semaglutide were circulating through the U.S. drug supply chain and asked consumers to check lot numbers to make sure they were using an authentic form of the drug. In February 2024, the agency sent warning letters to two companies for offering unapproved and misbranded forms of semaglutide and tirzepatide on their websites. In July 2024, the FDA warned patients about potential adverse events linked to some compounded forms of semaglutide due to dosing errors. The removal of semaglutide from the drug shortage list comes as public officials raise concerns about counterfeit and illegal forms of diabetes and obesity medications entering the U.S. On Feb. 19, the National Association of Attorneys General sent a letter to acting FDA commissioner Sara Brenner, MD, MPH, asking the agency to take steps to stop “bad actors” from profiting off the sale of counterfeit incretin-based drugs. The letter cited reports of counterfeit GLP-1s entering the U.S. from foreign countries, active ingredients of the drugs being sold illegally to consumers and compounding pharmacies that may be participating illegally in the market. The letter was signed attorneys general from 38 states and U.S. territories. “Demand for the medications Mounjaro, Zepbound, Ozempic and Wegovy has skyrocketed, but supply shortages and high costs have created opportunities for wrongdoers to cash in and endanger consumers,” the organization stated in its letter. “The FDA has the expertise and the resources to stop this conduct and better protect consumers.” Collapse Press Release Read more about Play on Healio Follow Healio About Account Information Contact Us Legal Sign Up for Email Get the latest news and education delivered to your inbox The email address associated with your Healio account is:  If you would like to edit or change the email address that your subscriptions and alerts are sent to, use the ""Update email address"" link.

FDA says shortage of Ozempic and Wegovy is over after more than two years - The Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/21/fda-ends-shortage-ozempic-wegovy/,"The Food and Drug Administration said Friday the shortage of Ozempic and Wegovy is over, a step that could spell the end to a booming market of cheap, pharmacy-made weight-loss drugs that has attracted a huge patient following. The FDA said it will give compounding pharmacies until April or May, depending on their regulatory status, to stop making versions of semaglutide, the active ingredient in the brand-name drugs. The move comes after the agency last year declared an end to the shortage of the other dominant weight-loss compound on the market, tirzepatide, which is the main ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound. As drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly struggled to keep up with enormous demand for their diabetes and obesity drugs, the FDA designated their medicines in shortage in 2022 — and kept them there. That made it possible for pharmacies to craft their own off-brand versions of the blockbuster drugs, a situation without modern precedent. Many compounding pharmacies — which traditionally custom-make prescriptions to suit individual patient needs — jumped into the weight-loss market, churning out less-expensive medications and selling them to telehealth firms and clinics across the country. Patients were willing to try non-FDA-approved medications that can cost a few hundred dollars a month rather than brand-name drugs that can cost $1,000 a month or more. An association representing compounding pharmacies estimated that they filled roughly 80 million prescriptions for semaglutide in 12 months. The stock of Hims and Hers, a publicly traded telehealth firm, got a boost when it began offering compounded semaglutide last year. The company promoted its weight-loss offerings in a Super Bowl ad as “affordable” and “doctor-trusted,” while criticizing brand-name drugs as “priced for profits, not patients.” Shares of Hims plummeted  25.8 percent  Friday. The company has suggested it could continue selling compounded semaglutide after the shortage ends by personalizing the prescriptions. “It is now critical to understand HIMS’ legal pathway to selling personalized doses since it has to be the primary mechanism to sell semaglutide going forward,” Michael Cherny, an analyst for Leerink Partners, wrote in a note to clients Friday. A spokesperson for Hims referred to a comment that the company’s CEO, Andrew Dudum, posted Friday on X. “Now that the FDA has determined the drug shortage for semaglutide has been resolved, we will continue to offer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law to meet patient needs,” Dudum wrote. Some medical providers who prescribe compounded weight-loss drugs are, for now, continuing their practice as usual. Jason Jacobson, a nurse practitioner in Florida who founded Slym Wellness, said he hasn’t heard from his suppliers that he won’t be able to get compounded semaglutide or tirzepatide. If those cheaper versions aren’t available, he said, he worries that patients who have lost a lot of weight will “rebound back to the state where they were at because of cost.” Jacobson said he has been reassured by the investments made by compounding pharmacies to continue offering weight-loss drugs, as well as big companies like Hims and Hers getting into the market. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have dominated the market for GLP-1 drugs, named for the glucagon-like peptide hormone that they mimic. The drugs work by slowing the stomach from emptying and sending a signal of fullness to the brain. Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Lilly’s Mounjaro treat Type 2 diabetes, while Wegovy and Zepbound are anti-obesity medications. As the two pharmaceutical giants have invested heavily to make more of their most popular offerings, they’ve aggressively targeted the compounding business with public statements and lawsuits, alleging that such medications aren’t safe. The FDA has long warned that compounded medications, which it doesn’t review, are less safe than products that go through its rigorous approval process. Lilly reported that Mounjaro brought in $11.5 billion last year, while Zepbound had $4.9 billion in sales, with most coming from the United States, according to a securities filing. Novo Nordisk said Ozempic had global sales of 120 billion Danish kroner last year, roughly equivalent to $16.8 billion. In a call with financial analysts earlier this month, a Novo Nordisk executive responded to a question about the effect of compounding pharmacies on its business. “Our latest market intelligence does tell us and show us that it is having an impact, and it is growing faster than we had anticipated,” said David Moore, an executive vice president, according to a transcript compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. On Friday, Moore said in a statement that the company is “pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand.” He added, “No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients.” Scott Brunner, CEO of the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, said that pharmacists have “long known that this shortage had a shelf life,” adding that they’ve “been serving patients who’d otherwise have no access to this medication.” Still, he questioned whether the FDA has adequately considered how patients currently taking compounded semaglutide — who he estimated number in the hundreds of thousands — will add to the demand for the brand-name drugs. In ending the shortage, the FDA acknowledged that patients and prescribers “may still see intermittent and limited localized supply disruptions,” as it said when declaring an end to the tirzepatide shortage.","Administration the Drug could and Drug Administration Administration The could Administration thThe couldt AdministrThe couldtion The couldnd Drug The could FridThe couldy Drug shortThe couldge AdministrThe couldtion could and Drug Administration Drug The could The could AdministrThe couldtion of cheThe couldp, phThe couldrmThe couldcy-mThe couldde Administration The could Administration thThe couldt could could and Drug Administration the end thThe couldt hThe coulds The couldttrThe couldcted The could huge Administration Administration Drug FDA sThe couldid it will give compounding phThe couldrmThe couldcies until April or MThe couldy, depending on Drugir regulThe couldweight-lossry stThe couldtus, weight-loss sweight-lossp mThe couldking versions of semThe couldglutide, Drug The couldctive ingredient in Drug brDrug-nThe couldme The could Administration thThe couldt could could and Drug Administration the end.

Michigan woman who tried micro-dosing Ozempic leaves doctors shocked with what it did to her body - Health - UNILAD,https://www.unilad.com/news/health/woman-micro-dosing-ozempic-results-382988-20250221,"Home> News> Health Liv Bridge A woman who tried micro-dosing Ozempic ended up stunning doctors with what it did to her body. There are countless ways to lose weight in this day and age, from the old school method of diet and exercise to the extreme with weight loss pills and even surgery. Now, one woman has decided to put Hollywood's hottest new drug to the test - and by taking it in a rather unusual way. Advert I am of course talking about Ozempic, an injection marketed for people with type 2 diabetes to help them manage their blood sugar levels, which has been snapped up by celebs, like Khloe Kardashian, Sharon Osbourne, Amy Schumer and even Elon Musk as a weight loss tool. Known as semaglutide, the drug was approved in 2017 by the US Food and Drug Aministration (FDA) to help diabetics, though some physicians have also been prescribing it for weight loss. The medication is administered once every four weeks with dosages starting from 0.25mg before increasing each time to the limit of 2mg. Advert But 25-year-old Madison Burgess has thrown caution to the wind by opting to micro-dose the drug. The Michigan native revealed she wanted to shed a whopping 50lbs and had tried everything in the past, like a strict workout regime, but her sweet tooth always won the battle, reports The Daily Mail. Madison said she was considering bariatric surgery in 2023, which makes the stomach smaller and restricts how much a person can eat, but then Ozempic arrived to the party. So, she signed up with Claya, a digital weight loss and wellness company, which put her in touch with a doctor who virtually prescribed her the ground-breaking drug. Advert At first, Madison, who has documented her weight loss journey on TikTok, reaped the rewards of the drug, noting how the inflammation and her appetite went down. She lost an incredible five pounds in the first week but just three months later, she started experiencing some debilitating side effects. When her dosage was increased above one miligram, she reported feeling nauseous, vomiting, severe stomach pain and had occasional diarrhoea or constipation. While such side effects are common, Madison said they were so severe she couldn't eat anything. Advert The young woman said she soon realized 'this is not okay' and wanted to find other solutions. After talking with her doctor, she suggested micro-dosing it and stripping it down to a dose that falls below the recommended amount. Madison has since gone on to shred 60lbs in two years and claims it was a miracle hack. Advert ""I’m a big advocate now of microdosing. Going slow and staying low is my motto nowadays and I think it’s better for long-term results,” she continued, claiming to have regained her appetite while resisting the temptation of sugary treats. ""It’s been absolutely great,"" she added. However, micro-dosing is not FDA-approved as a nurse practitioner specializing in medications like Ozempic, Katie Sorensen, explained to Parade comes down to a lack of clinical trials. Sorensen added: ""The microdosing strategy has some attractive benefits, including helping to mitigate side effects and being able to customize the dose to the minimum efficacious dose for individual patients."" It's also not a magical pill, as Madison describes it as 'just a tool' that helps support other lifestyle changes that help with weight loss.

"Ozempic Linked To Sudden Blindness, Study Discovers | OnlyMyHealth",https://www.onlymyhealth.com/what-is-the-link-between-ozempic-and-sudden-blindness-study-12977821848,"A recent study has raised concerns about a potential link between semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, and a rare form of vision loss called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). While the evidence is still preliminary, the possibility of this severe side effect has highlighted the need for patients and healthcare professionals to be informed about the risks associated with the drug. RELATED: What is ‘Ozempic Butt’? Expert Shares Tips On How To Manage This Side Effect  Ozempic was initially to help adults with Type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar levels. Its ability to promote significant weight loss as a side effect has led to its widespread off-label use for weight management. NAION is a condition that results in sudden, painless loss of vision due to reduced blood flow to the optic nerve head (ONH). It is the most common cause of sudden optic nerve-related vision loss in adults over 50 and is irreversible and untreatable. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the annual incidence of NAION in the U.S. ranges from 2.3 to 10.2 cases per 100,000 for those over 50 years old. The average age of onset is 66 years, and it affects men and women equally, with a higher risk noted among White individuals. According to the American Academy Of Ophthalmology (AAO), the following risk factors are prevalent.  Diabetes Smoking Hypertension Hypercholesterolaemia  What Are The Symptoms Of NAION?  Sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye (monocular). Rarely, bilateral vision loss due to significant blood pressure changes. Ocular discomfort and headaches are uncommon but possible in 10% of cases.  The Link Between Ozempic And NAION  The recent study conducted by researchers analyzing patient records from Denmark and Norway found that diabetic patients using Ozempic were more than twice as likely to develop NAION compared to those taking other diabetes medications. This follows a previous study that also suggested a potential connection between semaglutide and NAION. While these findings are significant, the overall incidence remains low. The researchers noted an increase of just 1.4 additional cases per 10,000 patient-years of observation among Ozempic users compared to those on other diabetes medications. Despite the low incidence, the irreversibility of NAION makes this a critical risk for patients to consider. Patients with diabetes are already at a higher risk for NAION due to vascular damage associated with the disease. The addition of semaglutide may exacerbate this risk by further impairing blood flow to the optic nerve. RELATED: Ozempic May Curb Alcohol Cravings: Study Details And Other Potential Benefits What Does This Mean For Patients And Healthcare Providers? Given the potential link, healthcare providers should inform patients about the possible risk of vision loss associated with Ozempic, monitor for early signs of vision changes, especially in patients with other vascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, smoking) and consider the patient’s medical history when prescribing Ozempic, especially for those with a history of optic nerve issues. Patients on the other hand should be aware of sudden vision changes and seek prompt medical attention if they experience any loss of vision, discuss their risk factors and potential alternatives with their healthcare provider if they are concerned about NAION. Is This Something You Should Be Worried About? The link between Ozempic and sudden blindness due to NAION remains a concerning but infrequent potential side effect. While further research is needed to establish a definitive connection, the severity of NAION warrants caution. Patients and healthcare providers must stay informed to balance the benefits of semaglutide for diabetes and weight management with the potential risk of irreversible vision loss.

Long-term weight loss effects of semaglutide in obesity without diabetes in the SELECT trial | Nature Medicine,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02996-7,"volume 30, pages 2049–2057 (2024)Cite this article 147k Accesses 2667 Altmetric Metrics details This article has been updated In the SELECT cardiovascular outcomes trial, semaglutide showed a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in 17,604 adults with preexisting cardiovascular disease, overweight or obesity, without diabetes. Here in this prespecified analysis, we examined effects of semaglutide on weight and anthropometric outcomes, safety and tolerability by baseline body mass index (BMI). In patients treated with semaglutide, weight loss continued over 65 weeks and was sustained for up to 4 years. At 208 weeks, semaglutide was associated with mean reduction in weight (−10.2%), waist circumference (−7.7 cm) and waist-to-height ratio (−6.9%) versus placebo (−1.5%, −1.3 cm and −1.0%, respectively; P < 0.0001 for all comparisons versus placebo). Clinically meaningful weight loss occurred in both sexes and all races, body sizes and regions. Semaglutide was associated with fewer serious adverse events. For each BMI category (<30, 30 to <35, 35 to <40 and ≥40 kg m−2) there were lower rates (events per 100 years of observation) of serious adverse events with semaglutide (43.23, 43.54, 51.07 and 47.06 for semaglutide and 50.48, 49.66, 52.73 and 60.85 for placebo). Semaglutide was associated with increased rates of trial product discontinuation. Discontinuations increased as BMI class decreased. In SELECT, at 208 weeks, semaglutide produced clinically significant weight loss and improvements in anthropometric measurements versus placebo. Weight loss was sustained over 4 years. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03574597. The worldwide obesity prevalence, defined by body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg m−2, has nearly tripled since 1975 (ref. 1). BMI is a good surveillance measure for population changes over time, given its strong correlation with body fat amount on a population level, but it may not accurately indicate the amount or location of body fat at the individual level2. In fact, the World Health Organization defines clinical obesity as ‘abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health’1. Excess abnormal body fat, especially visceral adiposity and ectopic fat, is a driver of cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD)3,4,5, and contributes to the global chronic disease burden of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cancer and other chronic conditions6,7. Remediating the adverse health effects of excess abnormal body fat through weight loss is a priority in addressing the global chronic disease burden. Improvements in CV risk factors, glycemia and quality-of-life measures including personal well-being and physical functioning generally begin with modest weight loss of 5%, whereas greater weight loss is associated with more improvement in these measures8,9,10. Producing and sustaining durable and clinically significant weight loss with lifestyle intervention alone has been challenging11. However, weight-management medications that modify appetite can make attaining and sustaining clinically meaningful weight loss of ≥10% more likely12. Recently, weight-management medications, particularly those comprising glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, that help people achieve greater and more sustainable weight loss have been developed13. Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, is approved for chronic weight management14,15,16 and at doses of up to 2.0 mg is approved for type 2 diabetes treatment17,18,19. In patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk, semaglutide at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg has been shown to significantly lower the risk of CV events20. The SELECT trial (Semaglutide Effects on Heart Disease and Stroke in Patients with Overweight or Obesity) studied patients with established CVD and overweight or obesity but without diabetes. In SELECT, semaglutide was associated with a 20% reduction in major adverse CV events (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.90; P < 0.001)21. Data derived from the SELECT trial offer the opportunity to evaluate the weight loss efficacy, in a geographically and racially diverse population, of semaglutide compared with placebo over 208 weeks when both are given in addition to standard-of-care recommendations for secondary CVD prevention (but without a focus on targeting weight loss). Furthermore, the data allow examination of changes in anthropometric measures such as BMI, waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) as surrogates for body fat amount and location22,23. The diverse population can also be evaluated for changes in sex- and race-specific ‘cutoff points’ for BMI and WC, which have been identified as anthropometric measures that predict cardiometabolic risk8,22,23. This prespecified analysis of the SELECT trial investigated weight loss and changes in anthropometric indices in patients with established CVD and overweight or obesity without diabetes, who met inclusion and exclusion criteria, within a range of baseline categories for glycemia, renal function and body anthropometric measures. The SELECT study enrolled 17,604 patients (72.3% male) from 41 countries between October 2018 and March 2021, with a mean (s.d.) age of 61.6 (8.9) years and BMI of 33.3 (5.0) kg m−2 (ref. 21). The baseline characteristics of the population have been reported24. Supplementary Table 1 outlines SELECT patients according to baseline BMI categories. Of note, in the lower BMI categories (<30 kg m−2 (overweight) and 30 to <35 kg m−2 (class I obesity)), the proportion of Asian individuals was higher (14.5% and 7.4%, respectively) compared with the proportion of Asian individuals in the higher BMI categories (BMI 35 to <40 kg m−2 (class II obesity; 3.8%) and ≥40 kg m−2 (class III obesity; 2.2%), respectively). As the BMI categories increased, the proportion of women was higher: in the class III BMI category, 45.5% were female, compared with 20.8%, 25.7% and 33.0% in the overweight, class I and class II categories, respectively. Lower BMI categories were associated with a higher proportion of patients with normoglycemia and glycated hemoglobin <5.7%. Although the proportions of patients with high cholesterol and history of smoking were similar across BMI categories, the proportion of patients with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥2.0 mg dl−1 increased as the BMI category increased. A high-sensitivity C-reactive protein >2.0 mg dl−1 was present in 36.4% of patients in the overweight BMI category, with a progressive increase to 43.3%, 57.3% and 72.0% for patients in the class I, II and III obesity categories, respectively. The average percentage weight-loss trajectories with semaglutide and placebo over 4 years of observation are shown in Fig. 1a (ref. 21). For those in the semaglutide group, the weight-loss trajectory continued to week 65 and then was sustained for the study period through week 208 (−10.2% for the semaglutide group, −1.5% for the placebo group; treatment difference −8.7%; 95% CI −9.42 to −7.88; P < 0.0001). To estimate the treatment effect while on medication, we performed a first on-treatment analysis (observation period until the first time being off treatment for >35 days). At week 208, mean weight loss in the semaglutide group analyzed as first on-treatment was −11.7% compared with −1.5% for the placebo group (Fig. 1b; treatment difference −10.2%; 95% CI −11.0 to −9.42; P < 0.0001). a,b, Observed data from the in-trial period (a) and first on-treatment (b). The symbols are the observed means, and error bars are ±s.e.m. Numbers shown below each panel represent the number of patients contributing to the means. Analysis of covariance with treatment and baseline values was used to estimate the treatment difference. Exact P values are 1.323762 × 10−94 and 9.80035 × 10−100 for a and b, respectively. P values are two-sided and are not adjusted for multiplicity. ETD, estimated treatment difference; sema, semaglutide. Among in-trial (intention-to-treat principle) patients at week 104, weight loss of ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15%, ≥20% and ≥25% was achieved by 67.8%, 44.2%, 22.9%, 11.0% and 4.9%, respectively, of those treated with semaglutide compared with 21.3%, 6.9%, 1.7%, 0.6% and 0.1% of those receiving placebo (Fig. 2a). Individual weight changes at 104 weeks for the in-trial populations for semaglutide and placebo are depicted in Fig. 2b and Fig. 2c, respectively. These waterfall plots show the variation in weight-loss response that occurs with semaglutide and placebo and show that weight loss is more prominent with semaglutide than placebo. a, Categorical weight loss from baseline at week 104 for semaglutide and placebo. Data from the in-trial period. Bars depict the proportion (%) of patients receiving semaglutide or placebo who achieved ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15%, ≥20% and ≥25% weight loss. b,c, Percentage change in body weight for individual patients from baseline to week 104 for semaglutide (b) and placebo (c). Each patient’s percentage change in body weight is plotted as a single bar. WC change from baseline to 104 weeks has been reported previously in the primary outcome paper21. The trajectory of WC change mirrored that of the change in body weight. At week 208, average reduction in WC was −7.7 cm with semaglutide versus −1.3 cm with placebo, with a treatment difference of −6.4 cm (95% CI −7.18 to −5.61; P < 0.0001)21. We analyzed achievement of sex- and race-specific cutoff points for WC by BMI <35 kg m−2 or ≥35 kg m−2, because for BMI >35 kg m−2, WC is more difficult technically and, thus, less accurate as a risk predictor4,25,26. Within the SELECT population with BMI <35 kg m−2 at baseline, 15.0% and 14.3% of the semaglutide and placebo groups, respectively, were below the sex- and race-specific WC cutoff points. At week 104, 41.2% fell below the sex- and race-specific cutoff points for the semaglutide group, compared with only 18.0% for the placebo group (Fig. 3). WC cutoff points; Asian women <80 cm, non-Asian women <88 cm, Asian men <88 cm, non-Asian men <102 cm. At baseline, mean WHtR was 0.66 for the study population. The lowest tertile of the SELECT population at baseline had a mean WHtR <0.62, which is higher than the cutoff point of 0.5 used to indicate increased cardiometabolic risk27, suggesting that the trial population had high WCs. At week 208, in the group randomized to semaglutide, there was a relative reduction of 6.9% in WHtR compared with 1.0% in placebo (treatment difference −5.87% points; 95% CI −6.56 to −5.17; P < 0.0001). At week 104, 52.4% of patients treated with semaglutide achieved improvement in BMI category compared with 15.7% of those receiving placebo. Proportions of patients in the BMI categories at baseline and week 104 are shown in Fig. 4, which depicts in-trial patients receiving semaglutide and placebo. The BMI category change reflects the superior weight loss with semaglutide, which resulted in fewer patients being in the higher BMI categories after 104 weeks. In the semaglutide group, 12.0% of patients achieved a BMI <25 kg m−2, which is considered the healthy BMI category, compared with 1.2% for placebo; per study inclusion criteria, no patients were in this category at baseline. The proportion of patients with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg m−2) fell from 71.0% to 43.3% in the semaglutide group versus 71.9% to 67.9% in the placebo group. In the semaglutide group, 12.0% of patients achieved normal weight status at week 104 (from 0% at baseline), compared with 1.2% (from 0% at baseline) for placebo. BMI classes: healthy (BMI <25 kg m−2), overweight (25 to <30 kg m−2), class I obesity (30 to <35 kg m−2), class II obesity (35 to <40 kg m−2) and class III obesity (BMI ≥40 kg m−2). The forest plot illustrated in Fig. 5 displays mean body weight percentage change from baseline to week 104 for semaglutide relative to placebo in prespecified subgroups. Similar relationships are depicted for WC changes in prespecified subgroups shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. The effect of semaglutide (versus placebo) on mean percentage body weight loss as well as reduction in WC was found to be heterogeneous across several population subgroups. Women had a greater difference in mean weight loss with semaglutide versus placebo (−11.1% (95% CI −11.56 to −10.66) versus −7.5% in men (95% CI −7.78 to −7.23); P < 0.0001). There was a linear relationship between age category and degree of mean weight loss, with younger age being associated with progressively greater mean weight loss, but the actual mean difference by age group is small. Similarly, BMI category had small, although statistically significant, associations. Those with WHtR less than the median experienced slightly lower mean body weight change than those above the median, with estimated treatment differences −8.04% (95% CI −8.37 to −7.70) and −8.99% (95% CI −9.33 to −8.65), respectively (P < 0.0001). Patients from Asia and of Asian race experienced slightly lower mean weight loss (estimated treatment difference with semaglutide for Asian race −7.27% (95% CI −8.09 to −6.46; P = 0.0147) and for Asia −7.30 (95% CI −7.97 to −6.62; P = 0.0016)). There was no difference in weight loss with semaglutide associated with ethnicity (estimated treatment difference for Hispanic −8.53% (95% CI −9.28 to −7.76) or non-Hispanic −8.52% (95% CI −8.77 to 8.26); P = 0.9769), glycemic status (estimated treatment difference for prediabetes −8.53% (95% CI −8.83 to −8.24) or normoglycemia −8.48% (95% CI −8.88 to −8.07; P = 0.8188) or renal function (estimated treatment difference for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 or ≥60 ml min−1 1.73 m−2 being −8.50% (95% CI −9.23 to −7.76) and −8.52% (95% CI −8.77 to −8.26), respectively (P = 0.9519)).

We reported in the primary outcome of the SELECT trial that adverse events (AEs) leading to permanent discontinuation of the trial product occurred in 1,461 patients (16.6%) in the semaglutide group and 718 patients (8.2%) in the placebo group (P < 0.001)21. For this analysis, we evaluated the cumulative incidence of AEs leading to trial product discontinuation by treatment assignment and by BMI category (Fig. 6). For this analysis, with death modeled as a competing risk, we tracked the proportion of in-trial patients for whom drug was withdrawn or interrupted for the first time (Fig. 6, left) or cumulative discontinuations (Fig. 6, right). Both panels of Fig. 6 depict a graded increase in the proportion discontinuing semaglutide, but not placebo. For lower BMI classes, discontinuation rates are higher in the semaglutide group but not the placebo group. Data are in-trial from the full analysis set. sema, semaglutide. We reported in the primary SELECT analysis that serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by 2,941 patients (33.4%) in the semaglutide arm and by 3,204 patients (36.4%) in the placebo arm (P < 0.001)21. For this study, we analyzed SAE rates by person-years of treatment exposure for BMI classes (<30 kg m−2, 30 to <35 kg m−2, 35 to <40 kg m−2, and ≥40 kg m−2) and provide these data in Supplementary Table 2. We also provide an analysis of the most common categories of SAEs. Semaglutide was associated with lower SAEs, primarily driven by CV event and infections. Within each obesity class (<30 kg m−2, 30 to <35 kg m−2, 35 to <40 kg m−2, and ≥40 kg m−2), there were fewer SAEs in the group receiving semaglutide compared with placebo. Rates (events per 100 years of observation) of SAEs were 43.23, 43.54, 51.07 and 47.06 for semaglutide and 50.48, 49.66, 52.73 and 60.85 for placebo, with no evidence of heterogeneity. There was no detectable difference in hepatobiliary or gastrointestinal SAEs comparing semaglutide with placebo in any of the four BMI classes we evaluated. The analyses of weight effects of the SELECT study presented here reveal that patients assigned to once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg lost significantly more weight than those receiving placebo. The weight-loss trajectory with semaglutide occurred over 65 weeks and was sustained up to 4 years. Likewise, there were similar improvements in the semaglutide group for anthropometrics (WC and WHtR). The weight loss was associated with a greater proportion of patients receiving semaglutide achieving improvement in BMI category, healthy BMI (<25 kg m−2) and falling below the WC cutoff point above which increased cardiometabolic risk for the sex and race is greater22,23. Furthermore, both sexes, all races, all body sizes and those from all geographic regions were able to achieve clinically meaningful weight loss. There was no evidence of increased SAEs based on BMI categories, although lower BMI category was associated with increased rates of trial product discontinuation, probably reflecting exposure to a higher level of drug in lower BMI categories. These data, representing the longest clinical trial of the effects of semaglutide versus placebo on weight, establish the safety and durability of semaglutide effects on weight loss and maintenance in a geographically and racially diverse population of adult men and women with overweight and obesity but not diabetes. The implications of weight loss of this degree in such a diverse population suggests that it may be possible to impact the public health burden of the multiple morbidities associated with obesity. Although our trial focused on CV events, many chronic diseases would benefit from effective weight management28. There were variations in the weight-loss response. Individual changes in body weight with semaglutide and placebo were striking; still, 67.8% achieved 5% or more weight loss and 44.2% achieved 10% weight loss with semaglutide at 2 years, compared with 21.3% and 6.9%, respectively, for those receiving placebo. Our first on-treatment analysis demonstrated that those on-drug lost more weight than those in-trial, confirming the effect of drug exposure. With semaglutide, lower BMI was associated with less percentage weight loss, and women lost more weight on average than men (−11.1% versus −7.5% treatment difference from placebo); however, in all cases, clinically meaningful mean weight loss was achieved. Although Asian patients lost less weight on average than patients of other races (−7.3% more than placebo), Asian patients were more likely to be in the lowest BMI category (<30 kg m−2), which is known to be associated with less weight loss, as discussed below. Clinically meaningful weight loss was evident in the semaglutide group within a broad range of baseline categories for glycemia and body anthropometrics. Interestingly, at 2 years, a significant proportion of the semaglutide-treated group fell below the sex- and race-specific WC cutoff points, especially in those with BMI <35 kg m−2, and a notable proportion (12.0%) fell below the BMI cutoff point of 25 kg m−2, which is deemed a healthy BMI in those without unintentional weight loss. As more robust weight loss is possible with newer medications, achieving and maintaining these cutoff point targets may become important benchmarks for tracking responses. The overall safety profile did not reveal any new signals from prior studies, and there were no BMI category-related associations with AE reporting. The analysis did reveal that tolerability may differ among specific BMI classes, since more discontinuations occurred with semaglutide among lower BMI classes. Potential contributors may include a possibility of higher drug exposure in lower BMI classes, although other explanations, including differences in motivation and cultural mores regarding body size, cannot be excluded. Is the weight loss in SELECT less than expected based on prior studies with the drug? In STEP 1, a large phase 3 study of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in individuals without diabetes but with BMI >30 kg m−2 or 27 kg m−2 with at least one obesity-related comorbidity, the mean weight loss was −14.9% at week 68, compared with −2.4% with placebo14. Several reasons may explain the observation that the mean treatment difference was −12.5% in STEP 1 and −8.7% in SELECT. First, SELECT was designed as a CV outcomes trial and not a weight-loss trial, and weight loss was only a supportive secondary endpoint in the trial design. Patients in STEP 1 were desirous of weight loss as a reason for study participation and received structured lifestyle intervention (which included a −500 kcal per day diet with 150 min per week of physical activity). In the SELECT trial, patients did not enroll for the specific purpose of weight loss and received standard of care covering management of CV risk factors, including medical treatment and healthy lifestyle counseling, but without a specific focus on weight loss. Second, the respective study populations were quite different, with STEP 1 including a younger, healthier population with more women (73.1% of the semaglutide arm in STEP 1 versus 27.7% in SELECT) and higher mean BMI (37.8 kg m−2 versus 33.3 kg m−2, respectively)14,21. Third, major differences existed between the respective trial protocols. Patients in the semaglutide treatment arm of STEP 1 were more likely to be exposed to the medication at the full dose of 2.4 mg than those in SELECT. In SELECT, investigators were allowed to slow, decrease or pause treatment. By 104 weeks, approximately 77% of SELECT patients on dose were receiving the target semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly dose, which is lower than the corresponding proportion of patients in STEP 1 (89.6% were receiving the target dose at week 68)14,21. Indeed, in our first on-treatment analysis at week 208, weight loss was greater (−11.7% for semaglutide) compared with the in-trial analysis (−10.2% for semaglutide). Taken together, all these issues make less weight loss an expected finding in SELECT, compared with STEP 1. The SELECT study has some limitations. First, SELECT was not a primary prevention trial, and the data should not be extrapolated to all individuals with overweight and obesity to prevent major adverse CV events. Although the data set is rich in numbers and diversity, it does not have the numbers of individuals in racial subgroups that may have revealed potential differential effects. SELECT also did not include individuals who have excess abnormal body fat but a BMI <27 kg m−2. Not all individuals with increased CV risk have BMI ≥27 kg m−2. Thus, the study did not include Asian patients who qualify for treatment with obesity medications at lower BMI and WC cutoff points according to guidelines in their countries29. We observed that Asian patients were less likely to be in the higher BMI categories of SELECT and that the population of those with BMI <30 kg m−2 had a higher percentage of Asian race. Asian individuals would probably benefit from weight loss and medication approaches undertaken at lower BMI levels in the secondary prevention of CVD. Future studies should evaluate CV risk reduction in Asian individuals with high CV risk and BMI <27 kg m−2. Another limitation is the lack of information on body composition, beyond the anthropometric measures we used. It would be meaningful to have quantitation of fat mass, lean mass and muscle mass, especially given the wide range of body size in the SELECT population. An interesting observation from this SELECT weight loss data is that when BMI is ≤30 kg m−2, weight loss on a percentage basis is less than that observed across higher classes of BMI severity. Furthermore, as BMI exceeds 30 kg m−2, weight loss amounts are more similar for class I, II and III obesity. This was also observed in Look AHEAD, a lifestyle intervention study for weight loss30. The proportion (percentage) of weight loss seems to be less, on average, in the BMI <30 kg m−2 category relative to higher BMI categories, despite their receiving of the same treatment and even potentially higher exposure to the drug for weight loss30. Weight loss cannot continue indefinitely. There is a plateau of weight that occurs after weight loss with all treatments for weight management. This plateau has been termed the ‘set point’ or ‘settling point’, a body weight that is in harmony with the genetic and environmental determinants of body weight and adiposity31. Perhaps persons with BMI <30 kg m−2 are closer to their settling point and have less weight to lose to reach it. Furthermore, the cardiometabolic benefits of weight loss are driven by reduction in the abnormal ectopic and visceral depots of fat, not by reduction of subcutaneous fat stores in the hips and thighs. The phenotype of cardiometabolic disease but lower BMI (<30 kg m−2) may be one where reduction of excess abnormal and dysfunctional body fat does not require as much body mass reduction to achieve health improvement. We suspect this may be the case and suggest further studies to explore this aspect of weight-loss physiology. In conclusion, this analysis of the SELECT study supports the broad use of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg as an aid to CV event reduction in individuals with overweight or obesity without diabetes but with preexisting CVD. Semaglutide 2.4 mg safely and effectively produced clinically significant weight loss in all subgroups based on age, sex, race, glycemia, renal function and anthropometric categories. Furthermore, the weight loss was sustained over 4 years during the trial. The current work complies with all relevant ethical regulations and reports a prespecified analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled SELECT trial (NCT03574597), details of which have been reported in papers describing study design and rationale32, baseline characteristics24 and the primary outcome21. SELECT evaluated once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiac events (a composite endpoint comprising CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke) in individuals with established CVD and overweight or obesity, without diabetes. The protocol for SELECT was approved by national and institutional regulatory and ethical authorities in each participating country. All patients provided written informed consent before beginning any trial-specific activity. Eligible patients were aged ≥45 years, with a BMI of ≥27 kg m−2 and established CVD defined as at least one of the following: prior myocardial infarction, prior ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, or symptomatic peripheral artery disease. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found elsewhere32. The trial protocol was designed by the trial sponsor, Novo Nordisk, and the academic Steering Committee. A global expert panel of physician leaders in participating countries advised on regional operational issues. National and institutional regulatory and ethical authorities approved the protocol, and all patients provided written informed consent. Patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner and 1:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo. The starting dose was 0.24 mg once weekly, with dose increases every 4 weeks (to doses of 0.5, 1.0, 1.7 and 2.4 mg per week) until the target dose of 2.4 mg was reached after 16 weeks. Patients who were unable to tolerate dose escalation due to AEs could be managed by extension of dose-escalation intervals, treatment pauses or maintenance at doses below the 2.4 mg per week target dose. Investigators were allowed to reduce the dose of study product if tolerability issues arose. Investigators were provided with guidelines for, and encouraged to follow, evidence-based recommendations for medical treatment and lifestyle counseling to optimize management of underlying CVD as part of the standard of care. The lifestyle counseling was not targeted at weight loss. Additional intervention descriptions are available32. Sex and race were self-reported. Body weight was measured without shoes and only wearing light clothing; it was measured on a digital scale and recorded in kilograms or pounds (one decimal with a precision of 0.1 kg or lb), with preference for using the same scale throughout the trial. The scale was calibrated yearly as a minimum unless the manufacturer certified that calibration of the weight scales was valid for the lifetime of the scale. Height was measured without shoes in centimeters or inches (one decimal with a precision of 0.1 cm or inches). At screening, BMI was calculated by the electronic case report form. WC was defined as the abdominal circumference located midway between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest. Measures were obtained in a standing position with a nonstretchable measuring tape and to the nearest centimeter or inch. The patient was asked to breathe normally. The tape touched the skin but did not compress soft tissue, and twists in the tape were avoided. The following endpoints relevant to this paper were assessed at randomization (week 0) to years 2, 3 and 4: change in body weight (%); proportion achieving weight loss ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15% and ≥20%; change in WC (cm); and percentage change in WHtR (cm cm−1). Improvement in BMI category (defined as being in a lower BMI class) was assessed at week 104 compared with baseline according to BMI classes: healthy (BMI <25 kg m−2), overweight (25 to <30 kg m−2), class I obesity (30 to <35 kg m−2), class II obesity (35 to <40 kg m−2) and class III obesity (≥40 kg m−2). The proportions of individuals with BMI <35 or ≥35 kg m−2 who achieved sex- and race-specific cutoff points for WC (indicating increased metabolic risk) were evaluated at week 104. The WC cutoff points were as follows: Asian women <80 cm, non-Asian women <88 cm, Asian men <88 cm and non-Asian men <102 cm. Overall, 97.1% of the semaglutide group and 96.8% of the placebo group completed the trial. During the study, 30.6% of those assigned to semaglutide did not complete drug treatment, compared with 27.0% for placebo. The statistical analyses for the in-trial period were based on the intention-to-treat principle and included all randomized patients irrespective of adherence to semaglutide or placebo or changes to background medications. Continuous endpoints were analyzed using an analysis of covariance model with treatment as a fixed factor and baseline value of the endpoint as a covariate. Missing data at the landmark visit, for example, week 104, were imputed using a multiple imputation model and done separately for each treatment arm and included baseline value as a covariate and fit to patients having an observed data point (irrespective of adherence to randomized treatment) at week 104. The fit model is used to impute values for all patients with missing data at week 104 to create 500 complete data sets. Rubin’s rules were used to combine the results. Estimated means are provided with s.e.m., and estimated treatment differences are provided with 95% CI. Binary endpoints were analyzed using logistic regression with treatment and baseline value as a covariate, where missing data were imputed by first using multiple imputation as described above and then categorizing the imputed data according to the endpoint, for example, body weight percentage change at week 104 of <0%. Subgroup analyses for continuous and binary endpoints also included the subgroup and interaction between treatment and subgroup as fixed factors. Because some patients in both arms continued to be followed but were off treatment, we also analyzed weight loss by first on-treatment group (observation period until first time being off treatment for >35 days) to assess a more realistic picture of weight loss in those adhering to treatment. CIs were not adjusted for multiplicity and should therefore not be used to infer definitive treatment effects. All statistical analyses were performed with SAS software, version 9.4 TS1M5 (SAS Institute).

Ozempic for Weight Loss: Will It Work for Me?,https://health.clevelandclinic.org/ozempic-for-weight-loss,"Advertisement This diabetes medication can treat obesity, but it’s not for people who just want to drop a few pounds Ozempic® may be one of the most talked-about medications in recent history. Celebrities are touting it. Social media influencers are shouting its praises. And doctors are hailing it as a research-backed breakthrough medication that could make a big difference. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy That’s because semaglutide, the generic name for Ozempic and Wegovy™, is highly effective in treating several chronic diseases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 42% of Americans are living with obesity (defined as a body mass index, BMI, of 30 or higher). For them, Ozempic and the class of anti-obesity medications called GLP-1 medications, which includes tirzepatide (Mounjaro®, Zepbound®), are being hailed as a major triumph. And for good reason. For people with a BMI lower than 30, the old standbys of diet and exercise are the best routes to maintaining a healthy body weight. But for people living with obesity or overweight, it may take more than simple lifestyle modifications and a bit more time to make real headway into weight loss. Recent studies of the newest anti-obesity medications Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound have shown benefits beyond diabetes and obesity, improving other chronic diseases, like heart disease, kidney disease, fatty liver and sleep apnea. So, they can not only help with someone’s weight loss journey, but they can also improve a person’s overall health and risk for chronic conditions. When it comes to Ozempic, how does it work for weight loss, who should take it and what are the risks? Obesity medicine specialist W. Scott Butsch, MD, MSC, helps explain why Ozempic has become so popular for weight loss and why new anti-obesity medications are a major victory for people with obesity. Advertisement Ozempic is a once-weekly injectable medication used to help manage blood sugar levels for those living with Type 2 diabetes. It’s commonly known by its generic name, semaglutide, and was approved for use as a diabetes medication in 2017. Dr. Butsch explains that Ozempic is the same medication as Wegovy, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 as an anti-obesity medication. With higher doses of semaglutide, Wegovy became the most effective obesity medication, producing 15% weight loss in a one-year randomized controlled trial. Although prescribing Ozempic for weight loss is considered “off-label”, there isn’t a difference between the two brand-named medications other than the dose. Using a medication “off-label” means it’s prescribed for a use other than its stated purpose. And it’s really common across the medical field. For example, you could be prescribed certain heart medications called beta-blockers for situational anxiety or your provider may prescribe anti-seizure medication to treat migraines. In the case of Ozempic, it makes total sense to use it to treat obesity, considering its sister medication, Wegovy, is approved for that use. Ozempic is a medication you inject once a week in your thigh, abdomen or upper arm. It’s in a class of medications called “GLP-1 receptor agonists” or “GLP-1 medications” for short. These medications mimic a hormone released from the digestive tract called glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), which helps lower blood sugar and promotes a feeling of fullness. “We’ve used GLP-1 receptor agonists for nearly 20 years to manage diabetes and obesity,” Dr. Butsch says. When you take Ozempic or other GLP-1 medications, your body makes more GLP-1, which naturally decreases your appetite and makes you feel fuller. But Ozempic isn’t simply a tool that suppresses appetite, Dr. Butsch clarifies. Ozempic, like other anti-obesity medications, not only changes how your body responds to weight loss, but also likely has effects beyond the weight loss benefits. “Obesity isn’t a behavioral problem. It’s not managed by just eating less or exercising more,” he continues. “Obesity is a complex, metabolic disease. It’s a dysfunction of the normal pathways that regulate our body weight or, more specifically, our body fat. Taking anti-obesity medications or other GLP-1s, like Ozempic, may change your body’s reaction to food intake and weight loss.” Advertisement In other words, Ozempic and anti-obesity medications work not simply because they’re correcting a “bad” behavior by lowering your appetite and causing you to eat less. They can affect the signaling between your gut and your brain, ultimately changing how your body responds to food. “These medications allow your body to seek a lower weight range, and this is not solely related to reducing your food intake,” Dr. Butsch says. “At the same time, GLP-1 medications may also lower your risk for a host of obesity-related diseases, like heart disease, chronic kidney disease, fatty liver disease and sleep apnea.” Think of this common scenario: When we “diet” and increase our exercise, we tend to hit a weight-loss plateau, which is where our bodies actively fight against continued weight loss. This is totally normal and expected. It’s part of what’s called your weight set point. Your weight set point is not a “point” or a number on a scale. It’s the weight level (or amount of body fat) your body wants to live at. It’s represented by a weight range your body thinks is good for you, even if your BMI says otherwise. The defense of body weight (or body fat) in humans has evolved to fend off starvation. When we lose weight, our body fears we’re starving because we have decided to “diet.” So, it mounts a defense to keep weight on. It sends in “hunger hormones,” lowers “fullness hormones” and decreases your metabolism, all in an attempt to keep your weight stable. In short, your body will battle tooth and nail against weight loss. Advertisement So, rather than simply making you want to eat less, anti-obesity medications like Ozempic change the very functioning of your body in order to help you lose weight and keep it off. It’s that metabolic and biological change that makes these medications appropriate for treating the disease of obesity, rather than providing a quick-fix weight loss “solution” for people who want to slim down to fit into last year’s jeans. You may experience weight loss within the first week or two when starting Ozempic. In fact, research has proven that higher doses of Ozempic — 2.4 milligrams of semaglutide — are very effective for weight loss in people with obesity. In one landmark study, people with obesity who used the medication in combination with lifestyle interventions lost about 15% percent of their body weight in 68 weeks. They lost about 34 pounds on average. Research participants who didn’t take the medication lost about six pounds on average. But weight loss isn’t the only benefit. When combined with a healthy nutritional plan and regular exercise, Ozempic and the newest GLP-1 medications can: Advertisement As Ozempic slows down your digestion, you may experience side effects and gastrointestinal issues like: These side effects tend to go away on their own after a few days or weeks. Paying attention to your diet by decreasing fat and fiber intake for the first few days after the injection and eating smaller portions tend to help improve these symptoms. Other more serious side effects may include: Ozempic isn’t safe for everyone. If any of the following apply to you, you should avoid taking Ozempic for weight loss: If you’re interested in taking Ozempic for weight loss and any of the above symptoms or conditions apply to you, talk to your healthcare provider about alternatives that may be appropriate. Dr. Butsch says that all signs point to the use of an anti-obesity medication as a safe and effective treatment for people living with obesity, yet it’s not being used as often as you’d expect. “Forty-two percent of people in the United States have the disease of obesity, but only 2% of them are being treated with anti-obesity medications,” he adds. Compare that with people living with diabetes — researchers say 88% of people who have diabetes use medication to treat their condition. What’s the difference? Though anti-obesity medications have been proven effective, there are several reasons people haven’t been able to access them readily: But these tides are turning (and quickly!) with the growing popularity of Ozempic and new GLP-1 medications, available coupon programs that can initially bring down the cost, and an increased willingness for healthcare providers to talk to patients about their obesity. But Dr. Butsch cautions against obtaining a prescription online from a so-called “diet doctor,” nail salon or any medical clinic offering compounded versions of Ozempic or the newer GLP-1 medications like Wegovy, Mounjaro or Zepbound. “Proper counseling about the lack of evidence, the unregulated and unclear information on ingredients, and the fact that the effectiveness and safety of these compounded versions of GLP-1 medications have never been formally tested is critically important,” he stresses. “Understanding that these compounded versions are not the same and may act differently in the body than the FDA-approved semaglutide and tirzepatide and, thus, cause harm, should help people temper their excitement and, in some cases, desperation to get on these medications.” “Obesity is a chronic disease,” Dr. Butsch continues. “Medications prescribed to treat obesity are used in the same way we treat diseases like high blood pressure or high cholesterol.” If these newer medications aren’t available, or affordable, there are many other medications to choose from. Not everyone needs to take a GLP-1 medication to lose weight. That’s why it’s important to go to an obesity specialist with experience treating obesity. “Medications are used in combination with lifestyle modification to increase long-term effectiveness,” he says. “One of the most common misconceptions is that people believe they could take a medication for a few months, then stop and maintain weight. However, you’re likely to regain the lost weight once the medication is stopped.” Like any other anti-obesity medication, Ozempic shouldn’t be used for short-term weight loss. In other words: Think of anti-obesity medication as a long-term commitment, not a quick fix for dropping a couple of pounds. You wouldn’t take insulin if you don’t have diabetes and shouldn’t take anti-obesity medication if you don’t have the disease of obesity. “We finally have medications that are highly effective in treating obesity for the long term, and it’s a game-changer for those who really need it,” reaffirms Dr. Butsch.

Does Celebrity Chatter about Weight-Loss Drugs Help or Harm?,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/does-celebrity-chatter-about-weight-loss-drugs-help-or-harm-2025a100044n,"February 18, 2025 Many celebrities are talking enthusiastically about their experiences with weight-loss drugs — especially semaglutide-based glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs; Ozempic, Wegovy). It’s no surprise that the recent Golden Globes was dubbed “Ozempic’s biggest night.” That show exemplified the fervent celebrity chatter that has helped send prescriptions for these drugs skyrocketing. Comedian Tracy Morgan, for example, told the Today show he got a prescription for Ozempic “and I ain’t letting it go.” In a recent y!entertainment article recounting Morgan’s experience, 17 other celebrities opened up about their use of the drugs. Concerningly, comedian Chelsea Handler revealed on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast that her anti-aging doctor “just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody. I didn’t even know I was on it. If you ever want to drop 5 pounds, this is good.” Experts say celebrity attention has both upsides and downsides. Celebrities bring visibility to the drugs’ efficacy in helping with weight loss — needed or not — potentially encouraging use among those who can benefit. However, they can overlook potential side effects or who’s an appropriate candidate for these drugs. In fact, lack of regulation over what can be said about these and other prescription treatments has led all countries except the United States and New Zealand to ban direct-to-the-public endorsements of prescription drugs by celebrities. But social media can easily overcome this barrier. The financial forecasting company Woodseer recently examined the effectiveness and issues surrounding celebrity endorsement of pharmaceutical products, looking specifically at Novo Nordisk (manufacturer of both Ozempic and Wegovy). “Active promotion” of Wegovy by Elon Musk and Amy Schumer has led to success that “seems to be explosive,” according to Woodseer’s report. “Unlike previous type 2 diabetes and weight-loss medications, Ozempic and Wegovy’s current thriving and forecasted stable growth has been mostly influenced by two events:…Trustworthy clinical trials worldwide and an increased demand due to successful celebrity endorsement.” A 2023 article published by the American Academy of Health Behavior addressed the influence of celebrity athlete endorsement in weight-loss advertisements targeting men. The authors wrote, “Findings suggest the presence of a celebrity athlete endorser made weight-loss advertisements more believable to consumers, even when ads contained obviously false claims.” The practice is unlikely to abate anytime soon. As Woodseer found, “Novo Nordisk demonstrates how celebrities’ contributions were both effective in global promotion and problematic for public health agencies. Novo Nordisk’s latest financial report confirmed that the company continues to grow in sales and global reach.” To gauge the power of celebrity endorsements and testimonials in the real world, particularly following comments made during the Golden Globes and in anticipation of the Oscars on March 2, Medscape Medical News spoke with endocrinologists on the front line. While every practice differs,our interviewees agreed that celebrity endorsements are a mixed bag, increasing public attention and awareness of the drugs as a potential weight-loss tool, but often not disclosing the full picture — for example, efficacy hinges on concomitant diet and exercise, the need to take the medication long-term, and the risks for side effects that can impair quality of life. Here’s what our interviewees told us. Priya Jaisinghani, MD, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York City, said, “Celebrity interviews and discussions can serve as a powerful platform to promote meaningful conversations about obesity, recognizing it as a chronic disease, and increasing awareness of evidence-based treatment options.” “By sharing personal experiences and normalizing the use of these medications, such discussions can play a pivotal role in reducing stigma both around weight and the use of GLP-1 therapies,” she said. “This destigmatization can foster a more supportive environment for individuals seeking medical care for obesity. Such endorsements can also increase awareness of emerging pharmaceutical therapies, motivating patients to explore evidence-based treatment options.” Nevertheless, she cautioned that celebrity culture often promotes unrealistic beauty standards. “For individuals in vulnerable populations, this emphasis on external image rather than health outcomes may inadvertently bring forth body image issues or create harmful comparisons. This dual-edged influence underscores the importance of framing these conversations in a way that prioritizes health and evidence-based care over superficial ideals.” She also warned that celebrity narratives can oversimplify the complexity of obesity treatment or promote drugs as a “quick fix,” rather than as part of a comprehensive, medically supervised plan. “Misrepresentation of these therapies can undermine public trust and potentially lead to misuse or unrealistic expectations among patients.” Clinicians should encourage patients to share information they’ve encountered in the media and discuss it openly during their visits, she added. “This creates an opportunity to address questions, clarify misconceptions, and provide evidence-based guidance tailored to the patient’s unique needs and health goals.” Caroline Messer, MD,Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York City, andHofstra School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York said, “Celebrities clearly influence my patients. Every few weeks, I receive an influx of questions based on recent celebrity posts. For example, for the past few weeks, I have received many queries regarding microdosing. Prior to that, there were several weeks where patients only wanted to discuss the risk of gastroparesis. When Kourtney Kardashian’s Lemme Gummies hit the market, my inbox blew up.” Echoing Jaisinghani, she said, “Celebrities help normalize these medications and remove the stigma. The downside of influencers is clearly that they are not medical professionals and often spread misinformation. Patients often come to us with myriad misunderstandings.” Peminda Cabandugama, MD, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, said his patients also seem to be influenced by celebrities talking about GLP-1 RAs, and often discuss what they’ve heard with him. He agreed that celebrities increase awareness about the drugs but said that patients may get the impression that taking the drugs alone would be enough for them to manage their weight. “This causes them to not always follow the bedrock of weight management, which is diet and exercise.” Furthermore, celebrities tend to have access to more resources than the typical patient, such as personal chefs and on-call personal trainers. “Patients need to realize that it is not just the medication that is helping the celebrity achieve their long-term goals,” and that the medications are not necessarily easy to obtain. He cautioned that celebrity-driven marketing can give the impression, “that weight management is a ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution,” instead of “an amalgamation of multiple modalities and a change in lifestyle that is helped by different tools for different people.” Anne Peters, MD, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, said that her patients, all of whom have diabetes, “tend to ask me for recommendations, not celebrities.” “I am sure celebrities influence people’s opinions, but I think people with a trusting relationship with their healthcare providers tend to listen to us,” she said. “I don’t mind if a celebrity makes a patient aware of a medication that could help, but ultimately it is the conversation with the healthcare professional that should determine suitability.” Celebrity influence becomes more complicated when it drives people to online pharmacies that may not fully vet which medications are appropriate, an approach Peters wouldn’t advise even if “the recommendation came from a celebrity or a neighbor.” However, she noted that celebrities have been used for public service announcements and are good at creating awareness for public health issues. Barbara Gisella Carranza Leon, MD, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, believes her patients also are being influenced by celebrities. “Patients are coming to the clinic requesting specific medications. This does not happen with most diseases.” Like other experts, she pinpointed unrealistic expectations as a key problem. Patients may not realize that weight-loss results vary from person to person. Celebrity comments may also encourage inappropriate use among those who aren’t candidates for these medications. “The cost of the medication is a big barrier for access. However, given that patients see the weight-loss results of these medications, they go to extreme lengths to try to get them, including using compounded medications.” On the other hand, she agreed that “having celebrities talk about the topic is good because there has been a lot of bias about obesity. Now we are talking about it and its complications.” She also questioned whether celebrities who don’t achieve their expected weight-loss results are ever asked to share their experiences. Research on the effects of celebrity influence and persuasion on patients’ requests for the drugs or willingness to take them would be helpful, she said. “Obesity is an epidemic. It is not going away anytime soon. The more we learn about how to help our patients, the better.” Readers are invited to share their experiences with celebrity influence in their practice in the “Comments” section. Jaisinghani is a speaker for Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Carranza Leon is a consultant for Novo Nordisk. Messer, Peters, and Cabandugama declared no relevant conflicts of interest.

A Type of Fiber Could Have Weight Loss Benefits Similar to Ozempic : ScienceAlert,https://www.sciencealert.com/a-type-of-fiber-could-have-weight-loss-benefits-similar-to-ozempic,"Research on the gut microbiome has triggered a 'revolution' in nutritional science, and in the last few years, dietary fiber has become the ""new protein"" – added to foods in abundance to feed our gut and boost our health. A recent study on mice, however, suggests not all fiber supplements are equally beneficial. A form that is readily found in oats and barley, called beta-glucan, can control blood sugar and assist in weight loss among mice fed a high-fat diet. Researchers at the University of Arizona (UA) and the University of Vienna say it is the only type of fiber supplement they tested that decreased a mouse's fat content and body weight within 18 weeks. The other fibers considered, including wheat dextrin, pectin, resistant starch, and cellulose, had no such effect, despite shifting the makeup of the mouse microbiome significantly compared to mice fed no fiber supplements. ""We know that fiber is important and beneficial; the problem is that there are so many different types of fiber,"" explained biomedical scientist Frank Duca from UA in July. ""We wanted to know what kind of fiber would be most beneficial for weight loss and improvements in glucose homeostasis so that we can inform the community, the consumer, and then also inform the agricultural industry."" Dietary fibers are the main source of energy for bacteria living in our guts, and yet less than 5 percent of people in the US consume the recommended 25–30 grams (0.9–1 ounce) of fiber a day. To make up for this, fiber supplements and 'invisible fiber'-infused foods are growing in popularity. But fibers are extremely diverse, so which do we choose? Some fibers, like oat beta-glucans and wheat dextrin, are water-soluble, meaning they are easily fermented by gut bacteria. Others, like cellulose and resistant starch, are less soluble or insoluble, meaning they stick to other materials to form stool. Until now, writes biomedical scientist Elizabeth Howard from UA and her colleagues, ""there is no study that has investigated the role of various fibers in one cohort."" To make up for this, the current study tested several forms of fiber in one cohort of mice. Only beta-glucan was found to increase the number of Ileibacterium found in the mouse intestine. Other studies on mice have linked this bacterium to weight loss. Sure enough, long before the 10-week marker, mice fed beta-glucan showed reduced body weight and body fat content compared to mice fed other forms of fiber. The findings align with another recent study by Duca, which fed barley flour, rich in beta-glucan, to rodents. Even though the rats continued eating just as much of their high-fat diet as before, their energy expenditure increased and they lost weight anyway. A similar outcome was observed in mice fed beta-glucan in the new study. These animals also showed increased concentrations of butyrate in their guts, which is a metabolite made when microbes break down fiber. Butyrate induces the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is the natural protein that synthetic drugs like Ozempic mimic to stimulate insulin release. ""Part of the benefits of consuming dietary fiber is through the release of GLP-1 and other gut peptides that regulate appetite and body weight,"" said Duca. ""However, we don't think that's all of the effect. We think that there are other beneficial things that butyrate could be doing that are not gut peptide related, such as improving gut barrier health and targeting peripheral organs like the liver."" Far more research is needed before these results can be extended to humans, but the findings suggest that some fibers may be better suited to weight loss and insulin control than others. The study was published in the Journal of Nutrition. An earlier version of this article was published in July 2024.","and in the the Research microbiome has the last few abundance abundance Research on science, and abundance the last and in the Research on fiber has become the and in the to foods abundance has the last few abundance abundance Research on science, and abundance proteabundance"" – added to foods abundance abundance to feed our Research and boost our health.

Why New Weight-Loss Drugs Like Mounjaro Cost so Much: Eli Lilly CEO - Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/why-weight-loss-drugs-expensive-cost-ozempic-mounjaro-zepbound-wegovy-2025-2,"The latest weight-loss drugs including Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound have list prices ranging from $900 to $1,500 for a one-month supply. David Ricks, the CEO of Mounjaro and Zepbound maker Eli Lilly, explained why these medications are so expensive on the ""In Good Company with Nicolai Tangen"" podcast this week. Developing a new drug costs about $3 billion, takes around 15 years, and has a high chance of failing, Ricks said. The huge costs, long timeframes, and slim probability of success means ""the return on that risk needs to be substantial,"" said the boss of America's 10th-largest company that's worth nearly $830 billion. The stock has risen 17% in the past year, and more than 500% since 2019. Once a drug is approved and being used by millions, there will often be calls for cost-plus pricing, Ricks said. But without the prospect of large profits, ""no one would have undertaken the risks to invent it."" By the time their latest wonder drug is approved and hits the market, pharma companies only have about 10 to 12 years to cash in before their patent expires and rivals can produce cheaper generics, Ricks said. Drug pricing reflects the limited timeframe they have to recoup their investment, earn sufficient profits to satisfy shareholders, and offset the cost of their many failed medications. When a drug patent expires, other drugmakers quickly roll out generics at a fraction of the price, stopping the inventor from earning monopoly profits but making the medication accessible to almost anyone who needs it. ""One of the great gifts of our industry is that everything we invent goes to zero for us and goes to infinity for society because generic drugs are such a great deal,"" Ricks said. Ricks pointed to Prozac, which Eli Lilly introduced in the late 1980s. The antidepressant is sold around the world and ""virtually free"" as it costs only four or five cents a day in major markets, he said. He called it a ""tremendous gift to society,"" and said his company deserves more credit for those long-term benefits while their drugs are under patent. When a new medication reduces costs for entire healthcare systems, its creators deserve a share of the savings, Ricks said. He highlighted research suggesting the new generation of weight-loss drugs reduces worker absences, results in fewer hip and knee replacements, and can help with conditions ranging from alcoholism and depression to schizophrenia. Their effectiveness in fighting conditions such as heart disease, liver disease, and diabetes could eat into 40% of the total healthcare costs of developed countries, Ricks said. Eli Lilly aims to ""capture some, not all, of the direct and indirect value we create,"" he added.

"Ozempic and similar weight loss drugs may lower risk of 42 health conditions, but also pose risks",https://theconversation.com/ozempic-and-similar-weight-loss-drugs-may-lower-risk-of-42-health-conditions-but-also-pose-risks-244243,"Clinical Epidemiologist, Washington University in St. Louis Ziyad Al-Aly receives funding from U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  Washington University in St. Louis provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. View all partners Several years ago, a little-known drug named Ozempic – previously used only to treat diabetes – emerged as a promising new drug for weight management. The Food and Drug Administration’s approval of Ozempic in 2021 for weight loss treatment ushered in a new era for the class of drugs called glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, or GLP-1. Today, GLP-1 drugs, including Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, have become household names and key tools in the fight against obesity: 1 in 8 American adults say they have used a GLP-1 drug, and forecasts show that by 2030, 1 in 10 Americans will likely be using these medications. Now, research from my lab and others suggests that GLP-1 drugs could help treat dozens of other ailments as well, including cognitive issues and addiction problems. However, my colleagues and I also found previously unidentified risks. I am a physician-scientist and I direct a clinical epidemiology center focused on addressing public health’s most urgent questions. My team works to address critical knowledge gaps about COVID-19, long COVID, influenza, vaccines, effectiveness and risks of commonly used drugs, and more. On Jan. 20, 2025, my team published a study of more than 2.4 million people that evaluated the risks and benefits of GLP-1 drugs across 175 possible health outcomes. We found that these drugs lowered risks of 42 health outcomes, nearly a quarter of the total that we analyzed. These include neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, substance use and addiction disorders, clotting disorders and several other conditions. Unfortunately, we also found that GLP-1 drugs come with significant side effects and increase the risk of 19 health conditions we studied, such as gastrointestinal issues, kidney stones and acute pancreatitis, in which the pancreas becomes inflamed and dysfunctional. One of the most important health benefits we found was that the GLP-1 drugs lowered the risk of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. These findings align with other research, including evidence from preclinical studies showing that these drugs may reduce inflammation in the brain and enhance the brain’s ability to form and strengthen connections between its cells, improving how they communicate with one another. These effects contribute to mitigating cognitive decline. Two other key studies have shown that patients treated with a GLP-1 drug for diabetes had a lower risk of dementia. All of these studies strongly point to a potential therapeutic use of GLP-1 drugs in treatment of the cognitive decline. Ongoing randomized trials – the gold standard for evaluating new uses of drugs – are looking at the effects of GLP-1 drugs in early Alzheimer’s disease, with results expected later in 2025. GLP-1 drugs have also demonstrated potential in reducing risks of several substance use disorders such as those involving alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, opioids and stimulants. This may be due to the ability of these drugs to modulate reward pathways, impulse control and inflammatory processes in the brain. The effectiveness of GLP-1 drugs in curbing addictive behavior may explain their spectacular success in treating obesity, a chronic disease state that many have suggested is indeed a food addiction disorder. Our study demonstrated a reduced risk of suicidal thoughts and self-harm among people using GLP-1 drugs. This finding is particularly significant given earlier reports of suicidal thoughts and self-injury in people using GLP-1 drugs. In response to those reports, the European Medicines Agency conducted a review of all available data and concluded that there was no evidence of increased risk of suicidality in people using GLP-1 drugs. Now at least two studies, including our own, show that GLP-1 drugs actually reduce the risk of suicidality. In addition to the well-documented effects of GLP-1 drugs in reducing risks of adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, our study shows a significant effect in reducing risk of blood clotting as well as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. One puzzling finding in our study is the reduced risk of infectious diseases such as pneumonia and sepsis. Our data complements another recent study that came to a similar conclusion showing that GLP-1 drugs reduced risk of cardiovascular death and death due to infectious causes, primarily COVID-19. This is especially important since COVID-19 is regarded as a significant cardiovascular risk factor. Whether GLP-1 drugs completely offset the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with COVID-19 needs to be thoroughly evaluated. GLP-1 drugs may also be useful in treating fatty liver disease and conditions ranging from asthma to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, depression and eye disorders. Despite their broad therapeutic potential, GLP-1 drugs are not without risks. Gastrointestinal issues, such as nausea, vomiting, constipation and gastroesophageal reflux disease are among the most common adverse effects associated with GLP-1 drugs. Our study also identified other risks, including low blood pressure, sleep problems, headaches, formation of kidney stones, and gall bladder disease and diseases associated with the bile ducts. We also saw increased risks of drug-induced inflammation of the kidneys and pancreas – both serious conditions that can result in long-term health problems. These findings underscore the importance of careful monitoring in people who are taking GLP-1 medications. A significant challenge with using GLP-1 drugs is the high rates at which patients stop using them, often driven by their exorbitant cost or the emergence of adverse effects. Discontinuation can lead to rapid weight gain. That’s a problem, because obesity is a chronic disease. GLP-1 drugs provide effective treatment but do not address the underlying causes of obesity and metabolic dysfunction. As a result, GLP-1 drugs need to be taken long term to sustain their effectiveness and prevent rebound weight gain. In addition, many questions remain about the long-term effectiveness and risks of these drugs as well as whether there are differences between GLP-1 formulations. Addressing these questions is critical to guide clinical practice.","Ziyad Epidemiologist, Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad Epidemiologist, Ziyad Veterans fundClinicalg Ziyad Ziyad Al-Aly receives Clinical Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad Veterans Clinical Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad Epidemiologist, Ziyad Veterans fundClinicalg Ziyad Ziyad Al-Aly receives Clinical Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad  Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad Epidemiologist, Ziyad Veterans fundClinicalg Ziyad Ziyad Al-Aly receives Clinical Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad Veterans Clinical Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad Ziyad provides fundClinicalg Several of The Conversation US.

Weight loss drug Wegovy approved to treat heart disease in overweight and obese Australian patients | Health | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/18/weight-loss-drug-wegovy-approved-to-treat-heart-disease-in-overweight-and-obese-australian-patients-tga,"TGA approved new indication for semaglutide drug in December 2024, but allocation to PBS still to be decided A weight loss drug has been approved to treat heart disease in overweight and obese patients by Australia’s medicines regulator, in what experts say is a “new frontier for the drugs”. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) granted approval in December 2024 for semaglutide 2.4 mg, sold under the brand name Wegovy, to be used as a complementary therapy for adults with both cardiovascular disease and high body mass index, to reduce the related risk of heart attack, stroke or death. While the new “indication” for the drug meant the TGA had satisfactory evidence of its benefits in regard to those particular conditions, it did not alter the cost of the drug – the decision for the government to subsidise its price and list it on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is separate. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Wegovy is part of the same class of drugs as Ozempic and Mounjaro, known as GLP-1 RAs, which mimic the hormone that stimulates the digestive system, essentially telling the body it is full after eating. Ozempic has been approved for use in Australia for management of type 2 diabetes, and approved on the PBS for that condition – but not put on the PBS for weight loss. Wegovy was approved by the TGA in August 2024 as a treatment for chronic weight management – but denied for the PBS. Wegovy’s approval as a prescription for cardiovascular disease followed findings from the Select trial, of 17,604 participants across 41 countries including Australia. They were all above 45 years of age with pre-existing heart disease and a body mass index of 27 or greater, but did not have diabetes. Half were given Wegovy and the other half a placebo. The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that compared with the placebo group, heart attack or stroke incidence among patients taking Wegovy reduced by 20%. Prof Stephen Nicholls, the lead of the Australian arm of the Select trial and the director of the Victorian Heart Institute at Monash University, said while the GLP-1 RAs medications were originally developed as diabetes drugs, the Select study excluding diabetic patients showed “a new frontier for the drugs in their own right”. Nicholls called the TGA approval a “significant result”. “We have really good medications for cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, but we’ve never been able to show that a medication that loses weight, or even a medication that we’re using specifically for people who are overweight, can actually reduce the chance of having a heart attack or a stroke,” he said. Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The study did not directly link the benefits of Wegovy for patients with heart disease to how much weight was lost; even patients who did not lose a lot of weight found the drugs positively impacted inflammation, blood lipids and blood pressure, all crucial in preventing heart attacks and strokes, Nicholls said. “There’s potentially a lot of people who might benefit from these therapies, and so we need better access,” Nicholls said, pointing to the need to improve availability and lower the cost for patients. Dr David Henry, an honorary adjunct professor in the faculty of science and medicine at Bond University, said the Select trial was strong. Whether Wegovy should get PBS listing for the new indication was a “more difficult question”, he said. With a “large population” likely to be now eligible to be prescribed Wegovy under the new indication, he noted “the budgetary effect [of putting it on the PBS] will be huge”.","used still new used semaglutide drug used semaglutide Decemusedr still used used semaglutide December still but PBS still used semaglutide December still but used decided TGA approved new indication used semaglutide drug obese patients 2024, but allocation to PBS still to be decided A weight to PBS still useden still used semaglutide December still but treat heart dusedease used semaglutide overweight and ousedse patients by TGA approved new indication used semaglutide drug obese patients 2024, but allocation to PBS still to be decided Australia’s medicused semaglutidees regulaused semaglutide December still butr, used semaglutide what experts say used a “new frontier used the drugs”.

Is Ozempic Safe For Weight Loss? Doctors Share Benefits And Risks,https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/is-ozempic-safe-rcna183494,"Ozempic is synonymous with weight loss for many people, even as they can turn to drugs with other brand names that have been tailored to treat obesity. The blockbuster Type 2 diabetes medication is not approved for weight management, but it comes with weight loss as a famous side-effect. “Most people have understood Ozempic as kind of a catch-all for the GLP-1 class of medications,” Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina, tells TODAY.com. GLP-1 drugs — which include Ozempic and its sister drug Wegovy, as well as Mounjaro and Zepbound — mimic at least one hormone produced by the gut to signal fullness, leading to a reduced appetite. About 12% of Americans have taken one of these popular medications, according to the KFF Health Tracking Poll. Journalist Johann Hari, who lost 42 pounds with Ozempic, calls the drugs a powerful tool, but also “a mass experiment, carried out on millions of people, and I am one of the guinea pigs.” “There’s a concern that maybe they’ll have some effect that we just don’t know in the long term,” Hari told TODAY.com, echoing a worry other patients may have. So is Ozempic safe? Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company that makes Ozempic and Wegovy, stands behind the safety and efficacy of all its GLP-1 medicines when they’re used as indicated and taken under the care of a licensed health care professional, it says in a statement to TODAY.com. Here’s what doctors say: Wegovy and Ozempic have the same active ingredient, semaglutide. “Technically, they are exactly the same,” Dr. Maria Daniela Hurtado Andrade, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic’s Precision Medicine for Obesity program, tells TODAY.com. Hurtado Andrade is a consultant for Novo Nordisk. But, ""practically, insurance companies will not cover Ozempic for the treatment of overweight or obesity,"" she clarifies. Ozempic is approved to treat Type 2 diabetes by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, while Wegovy is approved specifically for weight management in people with obesity or those who are overweight and have a complication like high blood pressure. Another difference between the two is the dosage, she notes. Wegovy doses go up higher, up to 2.4 milligrams weekly, versus 2 milligrams maximum for Ozempic. It’s not unusual for doctors to prescribe Ozempic off-label for weight loss, Hurtado Andrade says. It’s becoming less common as supply issues that made Wegovy hard to find have improved, McGowan adds. Novo Nordisk says Wegovy and Ozempic are not interchangeable. Semaglutide is a synthetic version of a hormone known as GLP-1, which the body releases into the intestine when people eat food, as TODAY.com previously reported. It signals to the brain that you’ve had a meal, so patients have reduced appetite, and when they do eat, they feel full sooner. The medication also slows down stomach emptying, which may contribute to the feeling of fullness. Adults with obesity or who were overweight lost 15% of their body weight on average after taking Wegovy for one year and four months, according to Novo Nordisk. Four years after starting semaglutide, patients maintained an average weight loss of 10% of their body weight, a peer-reviewed 2024 study funded by Novo Nordisk found. Doctors say the drug’s effects on the body can make people with obesity healthier. “On average, people lose a significant amount of weight. And along with that, other elements of their health then often get better, too,” Dr. Cecilia Low Wang, endocrinologist at UCHealth and professor at University of Colorado School of Medicine, tells TODAY.com. Low Wang, who chairs the FDA’s Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee, says she’s expressing her own views, and not speaking on behalf of the panel or the FDA. Obesity is a risk factor for Type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, cancer and mental health conditions like depression and anxiety, Hurtado Andrade adds. “Keeping in mind that obesity is at the core of many of these diseases, treating obesity can truly have a cascade effect of clinical benefits,” she notes. “These are life-changing medications.” The FDA has approved Wegovy to reduce heart attack and stroke risk. The most common side effects of Ozempic and Wegovy include nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation and vomiting, according to the manufacturer. Wegovy patients may also commonly experience headache, fatigue, upset stomach, dizziness, feeling bloated, belching, gas, stomach flu, heartburn, and runny nose or sore throat, Novo Nordisk notes. Potential serious side effects for Ozempic and Wegovy include possible thyroid tumors, including cancer; pancreatitis, vision changes, low blood sugar, kidney failure, gallbladder problems and serious allergic reactions, according to Novo Nordisk. Wegovy patients may also experience an increased heart rate, and depression or thoughts of suicide, the company says. Another concern may be muscle loss, Low Wang says. Currently available data on body composition do not indicate an association of greater lean body mass loss over fat mass loss with semaglutide treatment, Novo Nordisk says. No safety signal been found so far when it comes to lean mass loss with semaglutide, it adds. The use of GLP-1 drugs is associated with an 11% increase in arthritis risk, according to a large study published in Nature Medicine in January 2025. The study didn't specify which GLP-1 medications were included in the research, but ""it is reasonable to assume that semaglutide was among them,"" Novo Nordisk said in a statement. The company didn't address the arthritis risk finding specifically, but said it welcomes independent research investigating the safety, efficacy and clinical utility of its products. It also pointed out obesity is a major risk factor for developing osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, while weight loss is associated with an improvement in arthritis, according to studies. Research funded by Novo Nordisk and published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2024, found people with knee osteoarthritis who were treated with semaglutide for 68 weeks had significantly less knee pain than those receiving a placebo. Weight loss that resulted from the drug was probably ""a major contributor"" since it led to less stress on the knee joints, the authors wrote. Semaglutide is not approved in the U.S. for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, the company notes. In 2023, Novo Nordisk was sued by a woman with Type 2 diabetes who alleged Ozempic was among medications that caused  gastroparesis, or stomach paralysis. The case is still active in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, but there haven’t been any new filings since March 2024. A spokesperson for the company noted that gastroparesis is a known risk for people with diabetes and that ""patient safety is of utmost importance to Novo Nordisk."" Gastroparesis is not mentioned in the prescribing information for Ozempic or Wegovy, but delayed gastric emptying is mentioned for each drug. People who take GLP-1 medications may be at an increased risk of severe stomach problems such as gastroparesis, research published in JAMA in 2023 found. ""These adverse events, although rare, must be considered by patients who are contemplating using the drugs for weight loss,"" the authors wrote. In 2025, a small study in JAMA Ophthalmology focused on eye complications experienced by nine people who took GLP-1 antidiabetic drugs, including semaglutide. The review featured four semaglutide patients who developed nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), an optic nerve injury that can cause blindness, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. A previous study suggested people taking semaglutide may be at increased risk for this condition, described as ""a stroke of the optic nerve."" But the authors of both papers said they can't determine if the antidiabetic drugs cause eye complications until large clinical trials are done. It's possible that the rapid correction of high blood sugar induced by GLP-1 drugs rather than a toxic effect ""could be a possible mechanism for vision loss,"" the 2025 study noted. NAION is a very rare eye disease, and it's not an adverse drug reaction listed on the labels for semaglutide in the form of Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy, Novo Nordisk said in a statement. Data from clinical trials don't suggest a causal relationship between the drug and NAION, it added. ""After a thorough evaluation of studies from the University of Southern Denmark and Novo Nordisk’s internal safety assessment, Novo Nordisk is of the opinion that the benefit-risk profile of semaglutide remains unchanged,"" the company noted. ""We take all reports about adverse events from use of our medicines very seriously. This also relates to eye conditions, which are well-known comorbidities for people living with diabetes."" More studies are needed, but ""this is an important issue for ophthalmologists as we monitor usage of these drugs,"" said Dr. Bradley Katz, the lead author of the 2025 study and ophthalmologist at University of Utah Health, in a statement. Patients who experience sudden vision loss should stop taking the drugs and see a doctor immediately, Katz advised. Obesity often requires ongoing treatment, and most people “will have difficulty sustaining weight loss” after stopping the medication, Novo Nordisk says. Several doctors interviewed by TODAY.com believe semaglutide needs to be taken for years, decades or possibly life. Obesity is a chronic condition that needs chronic treatment, just like high blood pressure does, Low Wang says. “It’s likely to be a lifelong medication,” she notes. “It is a drug that we anticipate will require long-term use,” Hurtado Andrade adds. “We’re putting you on a treatment that is treating the biological basis of the disease, and if you stop that medication, then you’re not going to have that effect, and you’re very likely to regain the weight back.” Starting semaglutide is a commitment to stay on it long term, McGowan says. “Someone who’s considering taking a GLP-1 medication like semaglutide must plan to take it indefinitely,” he notes. “The GLP-1 medications are designed to be used in one way and only one way, which is continuously. That means a long-term, essentially lifelong use once you start it.” McGowan’s biggest concern is that a patient will discontinue their medication, which can lead to weight regain and recurrence of hunger that “can be extreme,” he says. But other doctors say more long-term data is needed before committing patients to this drug for life. “I understand there is an argument that obesity is a chronic disease like hypertension, diabetes, and once you need to be on it, you should be on it for lifetime. But I don’t think the data is there for the effectiveness of this class of drug on a long-term basis. There is a potential, but we’re not there,” Dr. Zhaoping Li, professor of medicine and chief of the division of clinical nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles, tells TODAY.com. “We need to be vigilant to monitor all our patients carefully. The best use of this class of drug would be leveraging the window of opportunity provided by the drug to help patients to improve lifestyle for longevity and quality of life.” Semaglutide in Wegovy and Ozempic has demonstrated safety and effectiveness in over 30 clinical trials, Novo Nordisk says. “Our GLP-1 products have a long history of use in treating Type 2 diabetes (over 19 years) and obesity (almost 10 years), supported by robust clinical data and over 22 million patient years of exposure,” the company notes in a statement. Novo Nordisk also says it work closely with the FDA to monitor the safety of its medicines. What about the possibility of a serious problem emerging years or decades down the road? “We always worry about that. … We’re constantly on the lookout for new side effects,” Low Wang says. “(But) with semaglutide being out for this many years, so far nothing has emerged that’s been really new in terms of safety signals.” She tells patients that the long-term safety of GLP-1 drugs isn’t known for sure, but doctors do have long-term experience with this class of medications. So far, there’s no evidence long-term use is harmful, Hurtado Andrade adds. Millions of patients are now using these medications, so it’s conceivable a rare, previously unidentified side effect may appear, but overall, “the concern is low that something new or unusual will emerge,” McGowan says. “It’s actually a very reassuring safety profile.” With what’s known now, the three doctors say they’re comfortable prescribing semaglutide long-term for weight loss for a patient eligible for the medication. With close monitoring by a health care provider, paying attention to any problems and periodically reassessing whether patients still need to be on the drug, “we can do this safely,” Low Wang says.

In other0other5, a small study in JAMA Ophthalmology focused on eye complications experienced by nine people who turnok GLP-1 antidiabetic with wotherh, including semaglutide. for many people, that review featured four semaglutide patients who developed nonarterotheric anterior turnchemic optic neuropathy (NAION), an optic nerve injury turn wotherh cause blindness, according turn the Ameriwotherh Academy of Ophthalmology.

More studies are needed, but ""thturn turn an important turnsue wotherh ophthalmologturnts wotherh wotherh wotherh we monotherurnr usage of these with wotherh,"" said Dr. Bradley Katz, the lead author of the other0other5 study and ophthalmologturnt at Universothery of Utah Health, in a statement. Patients who experience sudden vturnion with should sturnp taking the with wotherh and see a docturnr immediately, Katz advturned. Obesothery often requires ongoing with wotherh many people, that as with wotherh turn turn drugs wotherhment, and most people “will other difficulty sustaining wotherh with” after sturnpping the for many, Novo Nordturnk says. Several docturnrs interviewed by TODAY.com believe semaglutide needs turn be taken wotherh years, decades or possibly life. Obesothery turn a chronic condotherion turn needs chronic with wotherh many people, that as with wotherh turn turn drugs wotherhment, just like high blood pressure does, Low Wang says. “It’s likely turn be a lifelong for many,” she notes. “It turn a drug turn we anticipate will require long-term use,” Hurtado Andrade adds. “We’re putting you on a with wotherh many people, that as with wotherh turn turn drugs wotherhment turn turn with wotherh many people, that as with wotherh turn turn drugs wotherhing the biological bwotherh wotherh wotherhturn of the dturnewotherh wotherh wotherhe, and if you sturnp turn for many, then you’re not going turn other turn effect, and you’re very likely turn regain the wotherh back.” Starting semaglutide turn a commotherment turn stay on other long term, McGowan says. “Someone who’s considering taking a GLP-1 for many like semaglutide must plan turn take other indefinotherely,” he notes. “for many people, that GLP-1 for manys are designed turn be used in one way and only one way, which turn continuously. That means a long-term, essentially lifelong use once you start other.” McGowan’s biggest concern turn turn a patient will dturncontinue their for many, which wotherh lead turn wotherh regain and recurrence of hunger turn “wotherh be extreme,” he says. But wotherh docturnrs say more long-term data turn needed bewotherhe commotherting patients turn thturn drug wotherh life. “I understand there turn an argument turn obesothery turn a chronic dturnewotherh wotherh wotherhe like hypertension, with wotherh many people, that as with wotherh turn turn drugs wotherh, and once you need turn be on other, you should be on other wotherh lifetime.

WHO issues warning on falsified medicines used for diabetes treatment and weight loss,https://www.who.int/news/item/20-06-2024-who-issues-warning-on-falsified-medicines-used-for-diabetes-treatment-and-weight-loss,"The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a medical product alert on falsified semaglutides, the type of medicines that are used for treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity in some countries. The alert addresses 3 falsified batches of product of semaglutide class of medicines (of specific brand Ozempic), which have been detected in Brazil in October 2023, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in October 2023, and the United States of America in December 2023. WHO Global Surveillance and Monitoring System (GSMS) has been observing increased reports on falsified semaglutide products in all geographical regions since 2022. This is the first official notice issued by WHO after confirmation of some of the reports. “WHO advises healthcare professionals, regulatory authorities and the public be aware of these falsified batches of medicines,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. “We call on stakeholders to stop any usage of suspicious medicines and report to relevant authorities”. The semaglutides, including the specific brand product that has been falsified, are prescribed to people with type 2 diabetes in order to lower their blood sugar levels. Semaglutides also reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Most semaglutide products must be injected under the skin on a weekly basis but they are also available as tablets taken by mouth daily. These medicines are shown to suppress appetite in addition to lowering blood sugar levels, and therefore are being increasingly prescribed for weight loss in some countries. WHO has been observing increased demand for these medicines as well as reports on falsification. These falsified products could have harmful effects to people’s health; if the products don’t have the necessary raw components, falsified medicines can lead to health complications resulting from unmanaged blood glucose levels or weight. In other cases, another undeclared active ingredient may be contained in the injection device, e.g. insulin, leading to an unpredictable range of health risks or complications. Semaglutides are not part of WHO-recommended treatments for diabetes management due to their current high cost. The cost barrier makes these products unsuitable for a public health approach, which aims to ensure the widest possible access to medicines at the population level and to strike a balance between the best-established standard of care and what is feasible on a large scale in resource-limited settings. Also, there are more affordable treatments available for diabetes, with similar effects to those of semaglutides on blood sugar and cardiovascular risk. WHO is currently working on a rapid advice guideline on possible use of GLP-1 RAs, including semaglutides, for treatment of obesity in adults and as part of a more comprehensive model of care. The term GLP-1 RAs stands for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, which include semaglutides, for a class of medicines used for diabetes treatment to lower blood sugar and support weight loss. To protect themselves from falsified medicines and their harmful effects, patients who are using these products can take actions such as buying medicines with prescriptions from licensed physicians and avoid buying medicines from unfamiliar or unverified sources, such as those that may be found online. People should always check packaging and expiry dates of medicines when they buy them, and use the products as prescribed.

The drugmaker Novo Nordisk can meet current and future demand in the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration said. But patients may still see some supply disruptions as the medications move from the manufacturer to distributors and then to pharmacies. The injectable drugs have been in shortage since 2022. Compounding pharmacies and other entities that have been allowed to make and distribute off-brand copies of the drugs during the shortage will have to wind down production in the next few months, the FDA said. In December, the agency said the same thing when it declared that shortages had ended for Eli Lilly and Co.'s Zepbound and Mounjaro. Zepbound is approved to treat obesity and Mounjaro is approved for diabetes. They use the same active ingredient, tirzepatide. Ozempic, for diabetes, and Wegovy, for weight loss, use the active ingredient semaglutide. All four drugs are part of a GLP-1 class of treatments that has shown unprecedented results for helping people shed weight by decreasing appetite and boosting feelings of fullness.

Utah’s attorney general weighs in on weight loss drugs – Deseret News,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2025/02/21/letter-to-fda-attorney-general-derek-brown-ozempic-semaglutide/,"Utah’s Attorney General Derek Brown signed onto a letter along with attorneys general from 37 other states to ask the Food and Drug Administration to enforce the safety of weight loss drugs. The letter asks the FDA to “ramp up enforcement against any compounding pharmacies that may be illegally participating in the market,” per a press release issued Wednesday by Brown’s office. Brown said Friday that because of our “physical location,” Utah is dealing with a drug epidemic that includes the danger of buying and selling fake drugs. He added in the press release that the FDA needs to further investigate and protect consumers “against all the illegal and deceptive conduct.” Weight loss drugs like Ozempic or Wegovy have become popular in recent years. Their main ingredient, semaglutide, has been traditionally used to treat diabetics, but according to a study by KFF last year, 1 in 8 Americans have used it to lose weight. Its popularity has caused people to scour the internet looking for the drug — or a cheaper knockoff. “People are really taking a risk by ordering these products online and not knowing the supplier that’s sending it to them,” Salvatore Ingrassia, a port director for Customs and Border Protection at New York’s JFK Airport, told CBS News. Although they may look legitimate, Ingrassia added, “We’ve found things like antifreeze and incorrect amounts of active ingredients in these products.” Though he is new to the office, Brown told the Deseret News that he is the newest member of the executive committee of the National Association of Attorneys General. Unlike the Republican and Democratic AG associations, Brown said the NAAG includes all 56 AGs — from 50 states and six U.S. territories — collaborating on the office’s “nuts and bolts and business” through a bipartisan lens. He said the role involves establishing relationships with fellow attorneys, evaluating funding for critical programs and collaboratively addressing challenges that impact all communities. “This is an opportunity for Utah to really work with and get to know all the other attorneys general in the country, help them understand what matters to us, and work within a bipartisan fashion,” Brown said. “There are so many issues where it doesn’t matter if it’s a red state or blue state; it matters.” According to Brown, NAAG is tackling many pivotal issues aimed at enhancing the lives of Americans through legal means.","loss Administrandtion to Generandl Derek Brown signed generandl and generandl with andttorneys generandl from generandl other standtes to andsk the loss andnd Administrandtion to Administrandtion to generandl compounding phandrmandcies thandt mandy be illegandlly pandrticipandting in the mandrket,” per and press releandse issued Wednesdandy by Brown’s office.

"Startups test patches for weight-loss drugs, other medications",https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/02/19/business/patches-deliver-weight-loss-drugs-startups-anodyne-nanotech/,"The days of the hypodermic needle may be numbered. Several local startups are developing patch-like technologies that they hope could replace a painful poke with something that feels more like having Velcro against your skin for a few minutes. And it could work for weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic, or commonly used biological drugs like Humira, prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis. A 2024 study from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center found that about 15 million Americans use the new generation of weight-loss drugs, known as GLP-1 agonists, which require a once-weekly injection. Patch delivery has become common to deliver drugs like nicotine, Ritalin, or estradiol, a synthetic hormone that treats symptoms of menopause. But that’s because the smaller molecules of those drugs, placed against the skin, are easily absorbed. The larger molecules of a flu vaccine or a GLP-1 drug are not. Advertisement The first patch that could effectively deliver these kinds of drugs “would open the floodgates to a broader move away from the antiquated needle and syringe,” says Michael Schrader, a founder of several startups, including Cambridge-based Vaxess Technologies, which is working on drug-delivery patches. Several approaches in the industry have been tried without success, Schrader says. The latest, which Vaxess and several other companies are pursuing, use “microneedles” spread across a sticker to get into the skin with a little sensation of roughness — but no single poke. The microneedles are often made of polymers that have the drug integrated into them, so the medication simply dissolves once it reaches the fluid beneath the skin, rather than being funneled through a metallic needle, as with a typical hypodermic shot. One Boston startup working on patches, Anodyne Nanotech, is focusing initially on the GLP-1 weight loss drugs. Cofounder and chief business officer Konstantinos Tzortzakis confesses that he is “super needle-phobic, and I cannot swallow pills. When I need to have a blood test, I get nervous.” (As of last month, he had not yet had a flu shot for this season.) Anodyne — which means “without pain” in Greek and Latin — was founded in 2019, with a license to use microneedle design and manufacturing processes originally developed at Tufts University. Tzortzakis says that the microneedles on the patch that Anodyne is developing are less than one millimeter in length, “small enough that they don’t touch any nerve endings.” The big challenges, he says, are ensuring that a patch can deliver a large enough dose to be useful for a drug like Wegovy or Ozempic and that the patch can deliver the same dose reliably — rather than delivering a larger dose one week and a smaller dose the next. Advertisement Schrader says that latter issue was a key factor in the 2022 failure in clinical trials of another patch system, from Boston-based Radius Health. Radius had hoped to win Food and Drug Administration approval for a patch that would deliver a drug to treat osteoporosis; the patch technology was originally developed inside Minnesota-based 3M Corp. Radius didn’t respond to several requests for comment, but the company doesn’t seem to be continuing to pursue patch-based delivery, according to its website and recent press releases. Another company, Zosano Pharma, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2022 after its patch to help manage migraines flunked clinical trials. Vaxess originally was focused on using patches to deliver vaccines around the world more efficiently. That approach eliminates the need to keep them cold, or to have someone trained to administer the injections. But in December, Vaxess announced a collaboration with Novo Nordisk, the Danish company that makes Ozempic and Wegovy, to look at the efficacy of Vaxess’s patch — which relies on a small applicator device to affix it to the skin — for delivering those drugs. Schrader left Vaxess in 2024 to start another company. Rachel Sha, a veteran of the French drugmaker Sanofi, took over as chief executive last May. She says that Vaxess, with offices in Cambridge and a manufacturing facility in Woburn, has been working over the past year to generate data from animal testing that shows the patch can be effective in delivering GLP-1 drugs. (The company has not yet reported that data, but Sha calls it “quite impressive.”) Advertisement Vaxess has 42 employees and has raised nearly $100 million in venture capital funding and grants. Sha says that although the company has conducted early clinical trials for a seasonal flu vaccine that could be delivered with its patch, the company has shifted its focus away from a flu vaccine. She doesn’t expect clinical trials for delivering a therapeutic drug, like a GLP-1 agonist, to begin until 2026. A third local company, Lybra Bio, spun out from labs at Brigham & Women’s Hospital and MIT just last year. It envisions a patch to treat skin conditions like psoriasis and alopecia areata, which causes hair loss. Some drugs for those conditions, cofounder Núria Puigmal Domínguez says, are applied topically, and “don’t get to the deeper layers of the skin.” Others require injections designed to suppress the immune system, and they can impact the entire body, she says. Lybra envisions a patch that could deliver drugs to precisely where they’re needed on the skin — like the scalp, in the case of alopecia. Domínguez says the company has raised some early funding from individual investors and hopes to begin testing in humans by 2027. Anodyne has raised $9.5 million in funding so far and is currently trying to raise more, Tzortzakis says. So it’s still early days for these companies. Venture capitalist Bruce Booth of Atlas Venture, who is not an investor in any of the three local startups, says that needle-free delivery of medication and vaccines “is certainly a nut many are trying to crack.” Other competitors include Micron Biomedical, an Atlanta company that pulled in $16 million in funding last month, and an Australian company called Vaxxas. (Vaxxas has an outpost in Cambridge, located about three miles from Vaxess.) Advertisement If the next few years see patches for these kinds of vaccines and medications win approval, there will be several benefits. Drugmakers will get to extend the patent duration of a drug they’ve already developed — adding up to 20 years of patent coverage by combining it with a patch, creating a new type of “combination” product, according to DeAnn Smith of the law firm Foley Hoag. It’ll be cheaper and easier to get drugs to patients, Schrader explains, since refrigeration won’t be required. (He envisions a seasonal flu vaccine that could be sent to individuals in the mail once a year.) And trypanophobes — people who fear needles — would find life a little less stressful.

"Novo's Wegovy and Ozempic removed from US FDA shortage list, compounders on notice",https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-fda-says-shortage-novos-141446825.html,"By Patrick Wingrove and Bhanvi Satija (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday there was no longer a shortage of Novo Nordisk's popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs, Wegovy and Ozempic, a declaration that will curtail widespread sales of cheaper copies made by compounding pharmacies. Shares of Hims & Hers Health, which advertised its compounded versions of weight-loss drugs during the Super Bowl this month, plunged 22% to $52, on a day it announced the purchase of a plant to make the class of drugs that includes Wegovy and Ozempic. See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. U.S. regulations allow compounding pharmacies to copy brand-name medicines that are in short supply. Wegovy and Ozempic, both known chemically as semaglutide, were in shortage in the U.S. for much of last year. Americans who cannot afford Wegovy or have struggled to find it have been turning to often cheaper versions sold by pharmacies and telehealth providers like Hims & Hers and WeightWatchers. Wegovy has been shown to help patients lose as much as 15% of their weight on average. WeightWatchers shares were up 5.2% at 77 cents. For Hims and other compounders, this development starts the clock on having unfettered market access to Novo's drugs, Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a note. The sale of compounded versions of Eli Lilly's rival obesity and diabetes drugs, Zepbound and Mounjaro, was banned in December after the FDA found them to no longer be in short supply. The FDA said in a statement that compounding pharmacies would be given a grace period of 60 to 90 days, as was the case when Lilly's drugs were declared out of shortage. Robert Califf, who was FDA commissioner under President Joe Biden, said he did not think the agency's declaration would necessarily end obesity drug compounding. ""There so much money to be made. There's just an endless number of tricks that compounders could use,"" he said in an interview. ""So I don't think it's the end of it, but it certainly will bring us into a new era after the time period has passed and all the lawsuits are finished."" Scott Brunner, CEO of the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, which represents compounding pharmacists and technicians, questioned whether the FDA took into account the number of patients who will need to transition from compounded drugs to FDA-approved versions before making its announcement. The Alliance wrote to the FDA last year, saying more than 200,000 prescriptions for semaglutide drugs not manufactured by Novo Nordisk were being filled by U.S. patients each month, and the agency should consider their role in alleviating the obesity drug supply crunch before barring them. Hims CEO Andrew Dudum said in a posting on X that the company was closely monitoring for potential future shortages of the drugs. Novo said in a statement that the FDA's assessment confirmed that the U.S. supply of its drugs now meets or exceeds current and projected demand. U.S. listed shares of the Danish drugmaker rose 6.2% to $88.93. Novo and Lilly have invested billions to ramp up supply of their treatments, which lagged demand for most of last year. All doses of Ozempic and Wegovy were listed as available on the FDA's website in October, but the treatments had not been taken off the official shortage list at the time. The agency usually assesses if all back orders have been filled before deciding on whether a shortage has been resolved.

Shares of Novo Nordisk, the company that makes those drugs, shot up by more than 5% in early trading. Hims & Hers, an online pharmacy that sells compound versions of Novo’s drugs, fell by more than 20%. The move means that compounding pharmacies no longer have permission to make exact copies of Ozempic and Wegovy. There are still loopholes, though, that could allow pharmacies like Hims & Hers to continue selling compounding versions, like if they add or remove an ingredient based on a patient’s need. If a patient is allergic to a non-active ingredient in a drug that’s not in shortage, for example, a compounding pharmacy can still sell a version without that ingredient. Hims & Hers — which has gone all-in on selling weight-loss drugs — did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Its CEO, Andrew Dudum, has previously told Bloomberg he expects the company to offer compounded weight-loss drugs “indefinitely,” even after the shortages are lifted, as long as they’re customized for each patient. Dudum confirmed in a Friday statement on X that the company will ""continue to offer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law to meet patient needs.""

Hims & Hers Health Faces Setback as FDA Declares No More Shortage of Ozempic and Wegovy,https://www.apnakal.com/market/hims-hers-health-faces-setback-as-fda-declares-no-more-shortage-of-ozempic-and-wegovy/,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has officially announced that Novo Nordisk’s (NYSE:NVO) blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, are no longer in shortage. This development has significant implications for companies like Hims & Hers Health (NYSE:HIMS), which capitalized on the shortage by offering compounded versions of the treatments. With the supply shortage over, HIMS can no longer manufacture and sell exact copies of these in-demand drugs, causing a major shift in its revenue stream. During the prolonged supply constraints, patients turned to compounded versions of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. Compounders were legally permitted to produce these medications while they remained on the FDA’s shortage list, creating a booming secondary market. HIMS benefited from this opportunity as patients sought more affordable alternatives to the brand-name drugs, which cost approximately $1,000 per month. However, with Novo Nordisk resolving its supply chain issues, compounded versions are no longer permitted, putting a halt to this revenue stream for Hims & Hers Health. Although HIMS stock may face short-term challenges, the obesity drug market remains a highly lucrative space. With demand for these medications still at record levels, another supply constraint in the future could create a rebound opportunity for HIMS. The company has already built a strong reputation among patients seeking weight-loss solutions, positioning itself well if another disruption arises. Goldman Sachs estimates that the global obesity treatment market could reach $130 billion by 2030, while Morgan Stanley projects a valuation between $105 billion and $144 billion within the same timeframe. This staggering market potential continues to drive demand for drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), global obesity rates have more than doubled since 1990, and adolescent obesity has quadrupled. In 2022 alone, 390 million children and adolescents between the ages of five and 19 were classified as overweight, with 160 million suffering from obesity. These statistics highlight the urgent need for effective weight-loss solutions, ensuring continued demand for obesity medications. Novo Nordisk is experiencing unprecedented demand for its weight-loss drugs. According to The Guardian, obesity drug sales surged by 154% last year, generating 41.6 billion Danish kroner (approximately $4.8 billion) in revenue. Wegovy alone brought in £3.6 billion, while diabetes-related sales for Ozempic increased by 52%. With demand consistently outpacing supply, another shortage is always a possibility. If that happens, compounded versions of semaglutide may once again become viable, providing an opportunity for companies like Hims & Hers Health to regain lost momentum. While HIMS may see a decline in revenue due to the latest FDA update, it remains a stock worth monitoring. If another supply shortage occurs, the company could experience a strong resurgence. Until then, investors may want to exercise caution while keeping an eye on broader industry trends and potential future supply disruptions. As the obesity drug market continues to expand, the dynamics of supply and demand will play a crucial role in shaping investment opportunities in this space. Stay tuned for further developments as the industry navigates its next phase of growth.","Nordisk’s (FDA) The U.S. that Novo Nordisk’s Nordisk’s implications are drugs, Ozempic implications Wegovy, are no longer in shortage. are development The U.S. significant implications for companies like Hims & Hers Health (NYSE:HIMS), which capitalized on the shortage by offering compounded versions of the treatments.

FDA expands Ozempic to treat kidney disease in people with diabetes - McKnight's Long-Term Care News,https://www.mcknights.com/news/fda-expands-ozempic-to-treat-kidney-disease-in-people-with-diabetes/,"The US Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Ozempic for adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The drug is now indicated specifically to treat kidney failure, prevent death from cardiovascular disease, and lower the risk of kidney disease. Ozempic is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, or GLP-1 RA, known as semaglutide. The latest FDA approval makes the medication the first GLP-1 treatment option for people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, according to drug maker Novo Nordisk. Study data demonstrated that Ozempic helped cut the risk of death from CKD and major cardiac events in people with diabetes by 24%, the company said. The medication lowered the risk of kidney failure and slashed the mortality risk from heart disease by about 5% in adults with diabetes and CKD. Those taking the drug saw the risk for heart attack fall by 18% and the risk from all-cause death go down by 20% compared to those not taking the drug, data showed. The medication is also approved to decrease the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with diabetes and known heart disease. The drug has already been shown to reduce the risk for Alzheimer’s disease better than other diabetes medications in people with type 2 diabetes, a study out last year showed. About 40% of people with type 2 diabetes have chronic kidney disease, according to Novo Nordisk. Type 2 diabetes impacts approximately 37 million adults in the US, the company noted in a press release. Anna Windle, PhD, senior vice president of clinical development, medical and regulatory affairs at Novo Nordisk, said in the statement that the FDA approval addresses the rise in cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome. About one in three adults in the US has three or more risk factors for CKM syndrome, the American Heart Association reports. “With this new indication, Ozempic stands out uniquely as the most broadly indicated GLP-1 RA in its class,” she said.

As Healio previously reported, adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD receiving semaglutide had a 24% lower risk for kidney disease events, a 20% reduced risk for all-cause mortality and an 18% lower risk for CVD compared with those receiving placebo in the FLOW trial. Prior to the approval of the drug’s new indication, Matthew Weir, MD, professor and chief of the division of nephrology at University of Maryland School of Medicine, said he felt the FLOW trial findings made semaglutide “choice No. 1” for glucose control and reducing risk for cardiometabolic disorders. “Type 2 diabetes can be challenging enough to manage without the added risk of CKD, and I have seen in my own practice that patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD need extra support from medications that may have a profound clinical impact by lowering the risk of major kidney and CV outcomes,"" Richard E. Pratley, MD, medical director at the AdventHealth Diabetes Institute in Orlando, co-chair of the FLOW Trial and a Healio | Endocrine Today co-editor, said in a press release. ""A large portion of patients I treat experience serious kidney complications and comorbidities, with some even requiring dialysis. Today's decision by the FDA offers hope for the millions of adults living with both conditions and provides an additional treatment option, representing a significant advancement for my patients."" The FDA’s approval of a new indication is a “welcomed addition” to the therapies available to treat CKD, according to Kevin M. Pantalone, DO, ECNU, FACE, professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University, director of diabetes initiatives and staff endocrinologist in the department of endocrinology at Cleveland Clinic. “This new CKD indication for Ozempic is very important, as individuals with CKD are five times more likely to die from CV causes than to develop end-stage kidney disease,” Pantalone told Healio. “This new indication will not only allow us to reduce the risk of progression of CKD, or development of end-stage kidney disease in adults with CKD and type 2 diabetes, but will also aid in addressing the elevated CV risk that exists in that population.” The new indication is the most recent one approved for Ozempic. As Healio previously reported, the FDA approved a new indication for Ozempic in January 2020 to lower the risk for major adverse CV events in adults with type 2 diabetes and known CVD. ""This approval for Ozempic allows us to more broadly address conditions within cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, which affects millions of adults and could have serious consequences if left untreated,"" Anna Windle, PhD, senior vice president of clinical development, medical and regulatory affairs at Novo Nordisk, said in a press release. ""With this new indication, Ozempic stands out uniquely as the most broadly indicated GLP-1 receptor agonist in its class. We are proud to continue advancing innovations that will have a meaningful impact for this patient population, underscoring Novo Nordisk's commitment to cardiometabolic care."" Kevin M.

Novo Nordisk secures FDA approval for Ozempic in diabetes with CKD - Pharmaceutical Technology,https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/novo-nordisk-secures-fda-approval-for-ozempic-in-diabetes-with-ckd/,"The approval solidifies Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic as the most broadly indicated GLP-1RA in the US. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic (semaglutide) to reduce certain risks associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Danish drugmaker’s popular weight loss medication is now indicated to reduce the risk of kidney failure and disease progression, as well as death due to cardiovascular disease. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with CKD will be eligible for the approval. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more The new indication makes Ozempic the first glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) available for people with T2D and CKD. Novo Nordisk said its drug is the “most broadly indicated” GLP-1RA in its class. Novo Nordisk’s clinical development, medical and regulatory affairs senior vice president Anna Windle said: “This approval for Ozempic allows us to more broadly address conditions within the cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, which affects millions of adults and could have serious consequences if left untreated.” Ozempic gained a similar label expansion last month when the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved a new indication for the risk of events related to CKD. CKD affects around 37 million adults in the US and is expected to rise in line with diabetes prevalence. The disease is common in patients with diabetes, as high blood sugar can damage blood vessels in the kidneys and nephrons. Around 40% of diabetes patients will develop CKD, leading to additional symptoms such as cardiovascular problems. The FDA’s approval was based on results from the Phase IIIb FLOW study (NCT03819153) evaluating Ozempic in adults with T2D and CKD. The therapy helped reduce the risk of kidney disease worsening, end-stage kidney disease, and death due to cardiovascular disease by 24% compared to a placebo. Across the 3,533 patients who enrolled in the trial, kidney function declined more slowly and the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack dropped by 18%. The drug also cut the risk of cardiovascular-related deaths by 29% and the risk of death from any cause by 20%. As per its FDA label, Ozempic is also indicated to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with T2D and established heart disease. Novo Nordisk is eyeing up further indications for its blockbuster drug such as a potential treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and Alzheimer’s. The company has reported positive results showing Ozempic’s ability to reduce liver and fat scarring in MASH patients, as well as the risk of Alzheimer’s diagnosis.

"There’s still no generic Ozempic, but a lower-priced daily injected GLP-1 is coming | CNN",https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/23/health/generic-glp1-liraglutide-fda/index.html,"The US Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved a generic version of the daily injectable GLP-1 medicine liraglutide for people with type 2 diabetes, opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market and help address a shortage. Liraglutide, sold under the brand name Victoza for diabetes, is an earlier iteration in the same class as semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic. Both are sold by Danish drug giant Novo Nordisk. The generic liraglutide is sold by Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA, and a spokesman told CNN by email that the company expects to make the drug available nationwide before the end of the year. The company didn’t disclose the planned price of the generic, noting only that it “will cost less than branded Victoza.” Related article An experimental drug drove people to lose 23% of their body weight. It’s still seen as a disappointment The branded drug costs between $500 and $815 per package, depending on the dosage, before discounts or insurance, according to Novo Nordisk, which also sells a version of liraglutide approved for obesity, called Saxenda. “There are many people on this drug, and they will benefit by another generic version of it,” Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University and Yale New Haven Hospital, told CNN by email. But, Krumholz noted, the newer GLP-1 drugs, which are given as weekly injections instead of daily ones, have shown stronger benefits, especially for patients with obesity – and those aren’t yet available as generics. Those include Ozempic and its sister drug approved for obesity, Wegovy, which use semaglutide, and Mounjaro and Zepbound, for diabetes and obesity, respectively, which use the active ingredient tirzepatide. They can cost $1,000 a month or more without insurance or discounts. “This has the possibility of setting up a two-tier system whereby people who can’t afford the more expensive drugs are only able to use drugs with less strong evidence of benefit,” Krumholz said. Teva Pharmaceuticals, another maker of generic medicines, introduced an authorized generic version of liraglutide in June in the US, under a settlement agreement struck with Novo Nordisk in 2019. The authorized generic is manufactured by Novo Nordisk, and distributed and sold by Teva. It’s priced at a discount of about 14% to branded Victoza, according to pricing data shared by Erin Fox, a drug shortages and pricing expert at the University of Utah Health. An authorized generic is different from a generic drug, according to the FDA, because it’s the “exact same drug product” as a branded drug, just without the brand name on the label. A generic drug, like the liraglutide generic approved Monday, is a copy of a brand-name drug developed and made by another company. “Generic drugs provide additional treatment options which are generally more affordable for patients. Today’s approval underscores the FDA’s continued commitment to advancing patient access to safe, effective and high-quality generic drug products,” Dr. Iilun Murphy, the director of the Office of Generic Drugs in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. It may take a few more manufacturers bringing generics to the market for the price of liraglutide to come down significantly, said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. “It usually takes four or more independent generics in the market before prices reach reductions of 50-60% or greater than consumers usually expect from generics,” Kesselheim told CNN by email. “But the introduction of the first one is a positive step in the right direction toward that more competitive, multisource market.” Generics are also different from compounded drugs, which are versions made by pharmacies and allowed when medicines are in shortage. Compounded versions, particularly of semaglutide and tirzepatide, flooded the market as those drugs were in shortage over the last few years, although tirzepatide’s shortage was just declared to be resolved. The agency warns that compounded versions are not regulated as closely as generic and branded medicines. Liraglutide has been in shortage in the US since July 2023, according to an FDA database. The agency, in its Monday announcement, noted it “prioritizes assessment of generic drug applications for drugs in shortage to help improve patient access to these medications.” Dr. Jody Dushay, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an attending physician in endocrinology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said she hoped generic liraglutide’s price “will be significantly lower than name brand Victoza and Saxenda, but lessons from other drugs that are available as generics teach us that this takes time.” “I also hope,” Dushay added, “they will get into pharmacies and the hands of patients quickly.”","with type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market and with type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market and with type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market andnd with type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market and Administrwith type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market andtiof injectwith type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market andble with type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market and generic versiof of daily dwith type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market andily injectwith type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market andble GLP-1 medicine injectwith type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market andble people Drug Administration on Monday 2 diwith type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market andbetes, opening daily on for lower-priced optiofs to rewith type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market andch daily mwith type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market andrket with type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market andnd help with type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market andddress with type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market and shortwith type on Monday opening the door for lower-priced options to reach the market andge.

FDA Approves Ozempic to Treat Kidney Disease,https://people.com/fda-approves-ozempic-to-treat-kidney-disease-8782625,"Ozempic becomes the first GLP-1 treatment option for people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease Mario Tama/Getty The Food and Drug Administration has approved Ozempic to reduce the risk of kidney disease. On Tuesday, Jan. 28, the agency announced that the drug can now be used to reduce the risk of kidney failure and disease progression, as well as death due to cardiovascular disease, in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Ozempic is already widely used and was first FDA-approved in 2017 to treat type 2 diabetes. The medication — taken weekly by injection in the thigh, stomach or arm — is a brand name for semaglutide, which works in the brain to impact satiety. The FDA’s new approval makes the drug the first GLP-1 treatment option for people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. ""Chronic kidney disease is very serious and common in patients living with type 2 diabetes and represents a critical need for adults living with these comorbidities,” said Anna Windle — senior vice president of clinical development, medical & regulatory affairs for Novo Nordisk, maker of Ozempic — in a press release. “This approval for Ozempic allows us to more broadly address conditions within cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, which affects millions of adults and could have serious consequences if left untreated.” Getty Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. The decision was made following a clinical trial of more than 3,500 people where researchers found that weekly injections of the medication reduced the risk of kidney disease worsening by 24% in people who had diabetes. Additionally, the risk of death from heart disease in adults with both type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease was reduced by about 5%. “From my point of view as a doctor, you don’t get [diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease] in isolation,” Stephen Gough, Novo Nordisk’s global chief medical officer, told CNBC. “These illnesses, unfortunately, co-segregate. They cluster within the same individuals. So if you have a medicine that can target each of these co-morbidities in one injection, then you’re addressing what really matters to the patient.”","Ozempic Ozempic Ozempic first GLP-1 treatment option for people with option for diabetes and chronic kidney disease Mario Tama/Getty The Food and option for reduce the risk of kidney disease.

Ozempic is first GLP-1 drug FDA-approved for kidney disease | pharmaphorum,https://pharmaphorum.com/news/ozempic-first-glp-1-drug-fda-approved-kidney-disease,"Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 agonist Ozempic has become the first drug in the class to be approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of worsening kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes. The approval gives Ozempic (semaglutide) the broadest label in the class, coming after earlier approvals for type 2 diabetes itself and cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetics with known heart disease. Now, the drug is also indicated to prevent kidney disease worsening, kidney failure, and death due to cardiovascular disease in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). ""This approval for Ozempic allows us to more broadly address conditions within cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, which affects millions of adults and could have serious consequences if left untreated,"" remarked Anna Windle, head of clinical development, medical, and regulatory affairs at Novo Nordisk. CKD affects approximately 37 million adults in the US and is a common complication of diabetes, with approximately 40% of people with type 2 going on to develop the condition. The new label for Ozempic is based on the results of the FLOW trial, which showed a statistically significant reduction in kidney disease progression, as well as cardiovascular and kidney death with a 1 mg/kg weekly dose of the injectable drug compared to placebo. That is the same dose of the drug used in the formulation of Ozempic used for the maintenance treatment of diabetes. In the study, there was a statistically significant 24% relative risk reduction in the combined endpoint of kidney disease worsening, kidney failure, and death due to cardiovascular disease compared to placebo after three years, when added to standard of care. The absolute risk reduction at that time point was 4.9%. The new indication could give Novo Nordisk a boost against rivals in the GLP-1 agonist class, including Eli Lilly, whose dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist Mounjaro (tirzepatide) competes in the diabetes category and is in a phase 3 trial (TREASURE-CKD) looking at a CKD indication in people with obesity, with and without diabetes. The two drugs are also competing head to head in obesity, where Novo Nordisk sells its drug as Wegovy and Lilly's is called Zepbound. Ozempic made global sales of DKK 86.5 billion (over $12 billion) in the first nine months of 2024, while Lilly reported that Mounjaro made around $8 billion in the same period. Novo Nordisk is also looking to extend the indications for semaglutide even further, with trials on the go in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and Alzheimer's disease.","has become agonist to has become the first drug in be approved has become approved has become the FDA to reduce the to reduce reduce the risk reduce the risk of worsening kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes.

Ozempic Approved for Diabetic Kidney Disease | MedPage Today,https://www.medpagetoday.com/nephrology/diabetes/113985,"      Kristen Monaco, Senior Staff Writer, MedPage Today                        January 28, 2025 The FDA approved semaglutide (Ozempic) to reduce the risk of kidney disease worsening, kidney failure, and death due to cardiovascular disease in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD), making it the only GLP-1 receptor agonist to be granted this indication, drugmaker Novo Nordisk announced. The approval only applies to 0.5-mg, 1-mg, or 2-mg doses of semaglutide, which is already approved for adults with type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control and to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with known heart disease. It does not apply to 1.7 mg or 2.4 mg semaglutide (Wegovy), which is indicated for chronic weight management. Chronic kidney disease is a common complication of type 2 diabetes; around 40% of people with type 2 diabetes also experience CKD. The FDA's decision was supported by the phase IIIb FLOW trial of 3,533 adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD. In FLOW, treatment with once-weekly 1-mg semaglutide yielded a 24% relative risk reduction (4.9% absolute risk reduction at 3 years) for the primary composite endpoint  --  a sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥50%, sustained eGFR under 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, chronic renal replacement therapy, renal death, or cardiovascular death  --  compared with standard of care alone. The number needed to treat for 3 years to prevent one such event was 20. The study was stopped early due to meeting pre-specified efficacy criteria after a median follow-up of 3.4 years. ""Type 2 diabetes can be challenging enough to manage without the added risk of chronic kidney disease, and I have seen in my own practice that patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease need extra support from medications that may have a profound clinical impact by lowering the risk of major kidney and cardiovascular outcomes,"" said FLOW trial co-chair Richard Pratley, MD, of the AdventHealth Diabetes Institute in Orlando, Florida, in a statement. ""A large portion of patients I treat experience serious kidney complications and comorbidities, with some even requiring dialysis. Today's decision by the FDA offers hope for the millions of adults living with both conditions and provides an additional treatment option, representing a significant advancement for my patients,"" Pratley added. The most common adverse reactions with semaglutide that occurred in 5% or more of patients include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and constipation. The GLP-1 receptor agonist is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. The label also warns of the potential for acute pancreatitis, vision changes, hypoglycemia, acute kidney injury, severe gastrointestinal reactions, hypersensitivity, acute gallbladder disease, and pulmonary aspiration during anesthesia.

Novo Expands GLP-1 Dominance With Ozempic Nod for Kidney Disease - BioSpace,https://www.biospace.com/fda/novo-expands-glp-1-dominance-with-ozempic-nod-for-kidney-disease,"iStock, Victor Golmer Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster GLP-1 drug Ozempic has nabbed yet another label expansion outside of its original field, with the FDA granting approval for its use in chronic kidney disease.  Tuesday’s regulatory verdict, specifically for Ozempic’s use to reduce the risk of kidney disease worsening, kidney failure, and death from cardiovascular disease in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, makes Ozempic the “most broadly indicated” therapy in its class, according to a statement released by Novo. The GLP-1 was originally approved for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) in 2017. Three years later, Ozempic got the FDA’s greenlight for lowering the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with T2D and established cardiovascular disease. The drug, called semaglutide, continued to expand into weight loss as Wegovy in 2021, and last year Wegovy notched an approval for the reduction of cardiovascular risk. “This approval for Ozempic allows us to more broadly address conditions within cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome,” Anna Windle, senior vice president of Clinical Development, Medical & Regulatory Affairs at Novo, said in a statement. The FDA greenlight follows a similar approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in December 2024.  Rival GLP-1 maker Eli Lilly is similarly looking to push its tirzepatide, approved for T2D in 2021 as Mounjaro and in late 2023 as Zepbound for weight loss. Last month, the FDA approved Zepbound as the first ever drug for obstructive sleep apnea. And these two weight loss leaders aren’t the only ones going after other indications for GLP-1s. Ozempic’s label expansion into kidney disease was backed by data from the Phase IIIb FLOW trial, which according to a March 2024 readout showed a 24% reduction in the risk of kidney disease progression, kidney death and major adverse cardiovascular events, as compared with placebo. In a note to investors, analysts at BMO Capital Markets called the label expansion a “positive” for Novo, although one that “likely represents more limited commercial upside.” The BMO analysts noted that Ozempic’s expansion “adds to the mounting body of evidence showing GLP-1 agents’ utility in indications beyond T2D and obesity.” The label expansion for Ozempic could also help Novo keep ahead in an increasingly competitive obesity market, which in recent days has seen a flurry of clinical activity. On Monday, Veru Inc. posted topline Phase IIb data for its investigational selective androgen receptor modulator, touting a 71% drop in the loss of lean mass in seniors taking Wegovy. The same day, up-and-coming obesity player Metsera unveiled a $250 million IPO,eyeing a $1.78 billon company valuation. Then on Tuesday, Versant Ventures launched Helicore Biopharma—the investor’s fourth obesity-focused biotech in a year and the second new company in the space this month alone. © 1985 - 2025 BioSpace.com.

FDA approves Ozempic for diabetes patients to cut kidney disease risk | India News - The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/fda-approves-ozempic-for-diabetes-patients-to-cut-kidney-disease-risk-9806538/,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Novo Nordisk’s diabetes-cum-weight loss drug Ozempic for patients with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes. This came after clinical trials showed it reduced risk of kidney failure, disease progression and death due to heart problems. This is a significant breakthrough in managing diabetes-related conditions. The FDA approval is based on results from a trial investigating the effects of once-a-week Ozempic injections on major kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in adults with Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. It showed a 24 per cent reduced risk of worsening kidney disease and kidney failure (end-stage kidney disease) and also led to a 4.9 per cent risk reduction in death from cardiovascular disease. Ozempic contains semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA), which mimics the function of a hormone released by the intestine after eating. It lowers blood sugar by helping the pancreas make more of the glucose-regulating hormone called insulin. It can also help with weight loss by reducing appetite and increasing the feeling of “fullness”. The FDA approval is significant for India, where Ozempic will likely be available soon. “Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease so the medicine will be beneficial on a large scale. Prevention is of crucial importance so that we do not create an economic burden by increasing the number of kidney transplants,” said Dr Himanshu Verma, professor and head of the Nephrology department at VMMC and Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. Dr Verma said diabetic patients with kidney disease have different types of inflammation in their bodies. “Earlier diabetes management protocols were meant to control sugar and blood pressure to have the least impact on the kidney. Both these risk factors can damage blood vessels in your kidneys and lead to fibrosis or scarring of tissue. However, despite this, some inflammation persists and many diabetic patients end up developing kidney diseases. The newly-approved medicine will act on the inflammatory process, slow it down. So even if a diabetic person has kidney disease, the drug can slow down its progression in the initial stages.” According to Dr Anoop Misra, Chairman, Fortis CDOC Hospital for Diabetes, a substantial number of Indians with diabetes are at risk of developing kidney disease, yet treatment options remain limited. “This approval marks a significant breakthrough in managing diabetes-related complications, especially in a population where both kidney disease and obesity are rising concerns. We now have a drug that addresses multiple key aspects of diabetes, including obesity, blood sugar control, heart and liver health, and kidney disease,” he said.  Fruits may not be the first food that comes to mind when thinking of protein sources, but some varieties can contribute to daily intake.

The Medical Minute: What to know about Ozempic and weight loss drugs - Penn State Health News,https://pennstatehealthnews.org/2024/07/the-medical-minute-what-to-know-about-ozempic-and-weight-loss-drugs/,"Hardly a day goes by without another headline touting the benefits of new Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved injectable weight loss medications. “Weight loss drugs are among the most sought-after products sold in the U.S.,” said Dr. Taraneh Soleymani, director of Obesity Medicine at Penn State Health Medical Group. “Semaglutide and Tirzepatide have been game changers in treatment of obesity. It is no surprise that neither of the pharmaceutical companies making them, Novo Nordisk and Lilly, can keep up with the demand.” “Obesity is an epidemic. Seven out of 10 Americans are struggling with overweight or obesity. And this is not a disease that only affects Americans. It is a worldwide struggle,” Soleymani said. “People don’t have to hear about the new weight loss drugs from their doctor. They see their effectiveness in delivering significant weight loss in their neighbors, co-workers and family members.” Here, Soleymani discusses these medications and provides context and clarity around how they work and how they’re used and prescribed. How is Ozempic used? Ozempic, which has become synonymous with weight loss medication, is FDA-approved only for treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). It’s important for us to communicate this to our patients as there has been a great deal of misinformation on what is an FDA-approved drug for obesity. We have seen patients requesting their provider to start them on Ozempic, and it gets rejected by their insurance plan for coverage because the patient did not have T2DM. Popular culture has contributed to this kind of misunderstanding that Ozempic is a weight loss medication. Both Wegovy and Ozempic are Semaglutide but at a different dose, with Wegovy being approved by the FDA for treatment of obesity. The same is true for Mounjaro and Zepbound. Both are the antidiabetic medication Tirzepatide, but Zepbound is only approved for obesity treatment. Who should take Wegovy and other weight loss drugs? People who struggle with an overweight body mass index (BMI) of 27 to 29.9 with one comorbid condition related to their excess weight, like hypertension, or people who have obesity ― a BMI of 30 or greater ― would qualify for FDA approved weight loss medications including Wegovy, Zepbound, Saxenda, Contrave and Qsymia. In addition to weight loss, what other benefits does Wegovy provide? More than half of the participants in Wegovy research trials achieved 15% weight loss and one third achieved 20% or greater. This is an impressive amount of weight loss ― something we have not seen with previous weight loss drugs. This is important because a greater amount of weight loss we are able to more effectively treat obesity and its related co-morbid conditions. We’re now treating T2DM much more effectively ― reversing it in some cases ― helping patients come off their CPAP machines for obstructive sleep apnea or significantly reduce knee pain. Wegovy can also have a positive impact on cardiovascular health and kidney health outcomes. How do these medications work in regulating appetite and offering other health benefits? The new class of weight loss drugs that includes Wegovy and Zepbound work like the gastrointestinal hormones that naturally exist in our body. These medications act on several areas of brain involved in weight regulation. While reducing daily calorie intake and increasing daily calorie output are important for weight reduction, they do not go far enough in managing obesity. They fall short of influencing the pathways near the hypothalamus that regulate weight and appetite. Therefore, when weight loss medications are added to lifestyle modification, we are able to achieve and sustain a greater amount of weight loss because we are treating the disease much more effectively. These medications have also shown promise in managing binge-eating disorder, depression and addiction. We need more studies to better understand the mechanism and how to best use these drugs for our patients. Are there any negative side effects? As with all medications, potential side effects exist with weight-loss medications. In Wegovy trials, participants most commonly reported gastrointestinal side effects along with headache and fatigue. Zepbound also causes gastrointestinal side effects. When patients are properly monitored, guided and supported from a lifestyle modification standpoint (nutrition, physical activity and behavior), they tolerate the medication better. This is what we aim for with Penn State Health’s lifestyle program for obesity, Digital Weight Management. This six-month, structured lifestyle program allows us to partner with our patient in their weight loss journey to ensure it’s safe and effective. Must people remain on weight loss medication for life? I get this question a lot from patients and providers. Not many people may know obesity was recognized as a disease by the American Medical Association in 2013. It is a chronic and relapsing disease much like hypothyroidism or cancer. Once you treat the disease, the patient should stay on the treatment that works long term. If treatment is stopped, the disease will relapse. Weight loss drug trials have shown discontinuation of medication leads to weight regain. That’s because the brain pathways that regulate the weight are no longer treated by the medication. Feelings of discomfort with taking a medication for life are understandable. I would encourage patients to communicate their concerns with their health care provider. What’s the cost of Wegovy and similar drugs? It’s an expensive medication. Without coverage, the patient may pay out of pocket about $1,200 a month retail for Wegovy and $550 a month retail for Zepbound. A lot of progress has been made in terms of employers covering these drugs compared to a decade ago, but still not all employers include them as part of the insurance benefits they offer employees. This is also true with some insurance plans like Medicare that do not cover weight loss medications. Lack of coverage and high demand for these medications have led to a national shortage of Wegovy and Zepbound. Unfortunately, we have seen clinics, pharmacies and online weight loss programs offering compound Semaglutide and Tirzepatide. It is important for patients to know that these compounded versions are not the same as the actual drugs offered by Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Also, they have not been shown to be safe or effective, and are therefore not FDA approved. Are you hopeful that there will be even better drugs in the not-too-distant future? No question about it. This is a very hopeful time in the field of obesity medicine. For the longest time, all we could offer our patients was lifestyle modifications ― cut down your calories, be physically active ― which are important. But we were not really treating the physiology of the disease. We were not optimizing the effect of lifestyle change. With the introduction of the first FDA approved weight loss medication in 2012, we began to address the underlying physiology of obesity. And with the introduction of the new class of medications like Wegovy and Zepbound, we are doing a far more effective job. Looking down the road, there are more drugs in the later phase of clinical trials that mirror the results of bariatric surgery. It is an exciting time, as we have more treatment options than ever to offer our patients who struggle with obesity. The Medical Minute is a weekly health news feature produced by Penn State Health.

"Now, weight loss drugs can control chronic kidney disease among people with diabetes: Why is the US FDA approval significant? | Health and Wellness News - The Indian Express",https://indianexpress.com/article/health-wellness/ozempic-fda-approval-diabetes-kidney-disease-treatment-9805852/,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Novo Nordisk’s diabetes-cum-weight loss drug Ozempic for patients with both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes after clinical trials showed it reduced their risk of kidney failure and disease progression as well as death due to heart problems. WHY IS THE FDA NOD SIGNIFICANT? This is a significant breakthrough in managing diabetes-related conditions. The FDA approval is based on results from the FLOW phase 3b kidney outcomes trial investigating the effects of once-weekly Ozempic injection on major kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in adults with Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. It showed that 1 mg Ozempic led to a 24 per cent reduced risk of worsening kidney disease and kidney failure (end-stage kidney disease). It led to a 4.9 per cent risk reduction in death from cardiovascular disease. Ozempic contains semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA), which mimics the function of a hormone released by the intestine after eating. It lowers blood sugar by helping the pancreas make more of the glucose-regulating hormone called insulin. It can also help with weight loss by reducing appetite and increasing feelings of fullness. WHAT ARE EXPERTS SAYING? According to Dr Anoop Misra, Chairman, Fortis CDOC Hospital for Diabetes, a substantial number of Indians with diabetes are at risk of developing kidney disease, yet treatment options remain limited. “This approval marks a significant breakthrough in managing diabetes-related complications, especially in a population where both kidney disease and obesity are rising concerns. We now have a drug that addresses multiple key aspects of diabetes, including obesity, blood sugar control, heart and liver health, and kidney disease,” he says. Dr Himanshu Verma, professor and HOD, Nephrology, VMMC and Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi, says that diabetic patients with kidney disease have different types of inflammation in their bodies. “Earlier diabetes management protocols were meant to control sugar and blood pressure to have the least impact on the kidney. Both these risk factors can damage blood vessels in your kidneys and lead to fibrosis or scarring of tissue. However, despite this, some inflammation persists and many diabetic patients end up developing kidney diseases. The newly-approved medicine will act on the inflammatory process, slow it down. So even if a diabetic person has kidney disease, the drug can slow down its progression in the initial stages,” he says. WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR INDIA? The FDA approval is significant for India, where Ozempic is expected to be available by next year. “Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease so the medicine will be beneficial on a large scale. Prevention is of crucial importance so that we do not create an economic burden by increasing the number of kidney transplants,” he adds. The Surajkund International Crafts Mela, held in Faridabad, showcases the talents of over 2,500 artisans from India and around the world. This year, the fair celebrates the 'orange economy' and promotes the principles of ""Vocal for Local"" and ""Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.""

FDA approves Ozempic to reduce risks from chronic kidney disease in diabetes patients | CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/health/ozempic-kidney-disease-fda-approval/index.html,"Ozempic, the blockbuster GLP-1 drug that was originally approved to treat type 2 diabetes, has now also been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to reduce certain risks associated with chronic kidney disease, drugmaker Novo Nordisk said Tuesday. A Phase 3 clinical trial found that injections of the semaglutide medication once weekly reduced the risk of kidney disease worsening by 24% in people who also had diabetes. It also reduced the risk of kidney failure and cut the risk of death from heart disease by about 5% in adults with both type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, the company said in a news release. Related article Ozempic reduces risk of serious illness and death in people with diabetes and kidney disease, study finds Chronic kidney disease is a common complication for people living with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, which is one of the leading causes of death in the US and worldwide; about a third of adults with diabetes also have chronic kidney disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The clinical trial tested the efficacy of Ozempic when added to the standard of care, not as a replacement for other treatments for disease management such as medicines to manage blood pressure, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs. About 3,500 adults across 28 countries were enrolled in the trial, which started in 2019 and followed participants for an average of about 3½ years. The new indications, approved Tuesday by the FDA, make Ozempic the most broadly indicated drug in its class, with the largest set of specific medical conditions that it may be prescribed to treat. Novo Nordisk is conducting a different study to understand how and why semgalutide seems to reduce the progression of kidney disease, said Stephen Gough, global chief medical officer and senior vice president at Novo Nordisk. But even though scientists don’t fully understand the mechanisms behind them, the positive effects are strong: The clinical study was stopped early after reaching positive endpoints sooner than expected, and no new safety risks were identified in this trial, he said. “This really means something to the patients,” Gough told CNN. “The impact on not just kidney disease but also cardiovascular disease and on all-cause death.” Ozempic and other semaglutide injections such as Wegovy have been in short supply for years due to their rapid popularity. The FDA now lists Ozempic as “available,” but there is still high demand. “This is a medicine that’s already available, both in diabetes clinics and now in renal clinics, so I would hope the uptake would start pretty quickly,” Gough said, adding that he hopes the confidence that comes with the data behind this approval will aid clinicians who are making daily decisions about how and when to use different treatments. “It does help clinicians with their decision-making process, and it helps them focus those medicines to the patients who will benefit the most,” he said.","drug the blockbuster type drug that drug originally type to and Drug Administration to reduce certain and Drug Administration to reduce certain risks associated with and Drug Administration to reduce certain risks associated with chronic kidney disease, kidney disease, kidney disease, kidney disease, associated with and Drug Administration to reduce certain risks associated with chronic kidney disease, kidney disease, kidney disease, kidney disease, type 2 the has drug also drug the blockbuster type drug that drug originally type drug that drug Food and Drug Administration to reduce certain and Drug Administration to reduce certain risks associated with and Drug Administration to reduce certain risks associated with chronic kidney disease, kidney disease, kidney disease, kidney disease, associated with and Drug Administration to reduce certain risks associated with chronic kidney disease, kidney disease, kidney disease, kidney disease, and Drug Administration to reduce certain and Drug Administration to reduce certain risks associated with and Drug Administration to reduce certain risks associated with chronic kidney disease, kidney disease, kidney disease, kidney disease, associated with and Drug Administration to reduce certain risks associated with chronic kidney disease, kidney disease, kidney disease, kidney disease, said Tuesday. kidney disease, clinical that found that Phase 3 semaglutide medication once weekly type the risk of kidney disease worsening by 24% in people who also had diabetes.

Ozempic Receives New Indications in Chronic Kidney Disease,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/ozempic-receives-new-indications-chronic-kidney-disease-2025a10002ac,"January 29, 2025 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved semaglutide (Ozempic, Novo Nordisk) for reducing the risk for worsening kidney disease and cardiovascular death in adults with both type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. The approval is based on the phase 3b results of the international FLOW kidney outcomes trial, which involved more than 3500 individuals with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, randomized to once-weekly semaglutide or placebo plus standard care. The trial achieved its primary endpoint with semaglutide 1 mg, producing a significant 24% relative risk reduction of kidney disease worsening, end-stage kidney disease, and death due to cardiovascular disease. The absolute risk reduction compared with placebo was 4.9% at 3 years. This approval adds to Ozempic’s existing indications for adults with type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control and to reduce the risk for major cardiovascular events in adults who also have known heart disease. “Type 2 diabetes can be challenging enough to manage without the added risk of chronic kidney disease, and I have seen in my own practice that patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease need extra support from medications that may have a profound clinical impact by lowering the risk of major kidney and cardiovascular outcomes,” said FLOW trial co-chair Richard E. Pratley, MD, medical director at the AdventHealth Diabetes Institute, Orlando, Florida, in a Novo Nordisk statement. Pratley added, “A large portion of patients I treat experience serious kidney complications and comorbidities, with some even requiring dialysis.

"Retatrutide outperforms Ozempic in weight loss, new study finds - India Today",https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/retatrutide-outperforms-ozempic-in-weight-loss-new-study-finds-glbs-2661254-2025-01-08,"Listen to Story The new experimental weight loss drug, Retatrutide, is showing promising results. According to a study in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Retatrutide may help obese adults shed more pounds than current FDA-approved treatments like Ozempic and Wegovy. The Study Findings Researchers from McGill University reviewed 26 clinical trials involving nearly 15,500 participants to assess the effectiveness of various weight loss drugs for obese adults without diabetes. Among the findings, Retatrutide, nicknamed ""triple G,"" stood out. Participants who took the weekly injection lost up to 22% of their starting weight after 48 weeks, reports the New York Post. In comparison, semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, showed a weight loss of up to 13.9% over 68 weeks, while tirzepatide produced up to 17.8% weight loss over 72 weeks. How It Works Retatrutide mimics three hormones: GLP-1, which suppresses appetite; GIP; and glucagon, which helps regulate blood sugar. This multi-pronged approach appears to enhance its effectiveness in promoting weight loss. The study also noted additional benefits, including improved blood pressure among participants. Most weight loss occurred early in the treatment, with results plateauing over time. Other Promising Options The study examined 12 weight loss medications, including three FDA-approved drugs — liraglutide (Saxenda), semaglutide (Wegovy), and tirzepatide (Zepbound) — and nine others not yet approved for weight management. Researchers also highlighted a pill form of semaglutide, Rybelsus, which showed weight loss results comparable to injections. Other non-approved drugs, like Lilly's daily pill orforglipron and weekly injection mazdutide, also showed potential. Safety and Limitations Mild gastrointestinal issues, such as nausea and diarrhea, were the most commonly reported side effects. While 22 deaths were reported across the trials, investigators found no direct link between the deaths and the trial drugs. McGill researchers called for more studies, particularly head-to-head comparisons of GLP-1 drugs, to better understand their effectiveness and safety. What’s Next? Retatrutide is still in Phase 3 trials, expected to last until January 2026, meaning FDA approval and public availability are still years away. Experts suggest further research could explore combining therapies for even greater benefits. With the global demand for effective weight loss solutions on the rise, Retatrutide could represent a significant breakthrough in obesity treatment. For now, it remains a beacon of hope for future advancements in weight management.Published By: indiatodayglobal Published On: Jan 8, 2025","results. to a results. new experimental Listen to a loss drug, Retatrutide, results. results. promresults.ing results.

Compounded Semaglutide: Why Caution Is Advised,https://www.healthline.com/health/compounded-semaglutide,"Semaglutide is a generic medication. Its brand names are approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Compounded semaglutide is not FDA-approved, could come with risks, and may lead to adverse effects. In the United States, semaglutide isn’t available as a generic drug. It’s sold with a prescription under the following brand names: Compounding involves mixing or altering drug ingredients to create a medication for a specific need. The practice is common during medication shortages, but it doesn’t come without concerns. Compounded medications aren’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and don’t undergo the same rigorous safety and effectiveness testing as approved medications. Because of this, compounded drugs may be more prone to contamination or mislabeling. The FDA advises against using a compounded medication when an FDA-approved medication is available. It also warns that potential complications are possible since the organization does not regulate compounded drugs. For semaglutide, the FDA has received reports of: In a 2023 case series, researchers reported three instances of incorrectly administered compounded semaglutide obtained from an aesthetic spa. Users developed gastrointestinal symptoms lasting for days that included: Two people self-administered more than 10 times the recommended semaglutide dose. One of them required intravenous (IV) administration of fluids. Branded semaglutide, like Ozempic and Wegovy, comes in a prefilled injection pen, which acts as a safety feature to prevent overdosing. The reported compounded semaglutide didn’t have this system. Novo Nordisk produces all three branded semaglutide medications available in the United States. According to its website, the company has filed nine legal proceedings against medical spas, weight loss clinics, and other companies for the unlawful sale of compounded semaglutide medications. If you decide to take a compounded drug, the FDA recommends working with a state-licensed pharmacy in the United States. That way, the FDA and state authorities may assess the quality of drug manufacturing. Compounded semaglutide is a custom-made medication that may include the same active ingredient as the original drug, but it isn’t regulated for safety and effectiveness. Compounded semaglutide isn’t approved by the FDA. All semaglutide medications, including compounded medications, require a prescription in the United States. Some online retailers based outside the United States may sell semaglutide without asking for a prescription, but importing these medications into the United States is illegal and often dangerous. Compounded semaglutide medications are often significantly cheaper than branded alternatives. They can also help increase availability when branded medications are in short supply. Compounded semaglutide produced by reputable manufacturers contains the same active ingredient as branded alternatives. Some manufacturers may combine semaglutide with vitamin B12 to help reduce the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, which can occur in people taking semaglutide or other medications that fall into the same class of drugs. Semaglutide isn’t currently available as a generic drug. Some experts have raised concerns about where compounding facilities find semaglutide if Novo Nordisk, its sole manufacturer, isn’t providing the active ingredient. The FDA has found many cases of unscrupulous sellers using the salt forms of semaglutide, such as semaglutide sodium and semaglutide acetate, instead of the base form found in branded medications. According to the FDA, compounded semaglutide versions that contain the salt forms of the drug “have not been shown to be safe and effective.” General side effects of semaglutide include: Semaglutide can also lead to complications in some people, including: In rodents, semaglutide has been linked to an increased risk of thyroid C-cell tumors. It’s not clear if semaglutide also increases the risk of thyroid cancer in humans. It may be a good idea to avoid semaglutide if you have a family history of: Compounded semaglutide may cause additional side effects and complications, especially when ingredients and drug applicators aren’t of optimal quality. Insurance plans rarely provide coverage for medications used solely for weight loss. For example, weight loss drugs are excluded from coverage from the government programs Medicaid and Medicare. Some insurance companies may offer coverage for semaglutide to treat type 2 diabetes. Providers that offer coverage for branded semaglutide may also offer coverage for compounded semaglutide in limited cases. For example, Cigna provides coverage for compounded medication when you have documentation that you can’t take or are intolerant to all FDA-approved commercially available alternatives. They may have additional requirements for coverage. If you have questions about insurance coverage for compounded semaglutide, consider reviewing your plan’s coverage literature or calling the company directly. Some questions you may want to ask include: Read about how to get semaglutide. Compounded semaglutide isn’t FDA-approved, and the FDA only recommends taking compounded medications if FDA-approved alternatives are unavailable. If you decide to get compounded semaglutide, it’s important to make sure you work with a state-licensed pharmacy based in the United States. You should also be aware of the potential risks of compounded semaglutide, including adverse effects from incorrect dosage and undisclosed ingredients.","generic medicSemaglutide istion. generic medicSemaglutide istion. medicSemaglutide istion. not FDA-Semaglutide ispproved, could Semaglutide isre Semaglutide ispproved for the not FDA-Semaglutide ispproved, could SemSemaglutide isglutide diSemaglutide isbetes Semaglutide isnd obesity.

Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic granted FDA approval in chronic kidney disease - PMLiVE,https://pmlive.com/pharma_news/novo-nordisks-ozempic-granted-fda-approval-in-chronic-kidney-disease/,"More results... Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic (semaglutide) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce the risk of kidney disease worsening, kidney failure and cardiovascular disease (CVD) death in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The decision makes Ozempic the only glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved for this patient population and the “most broadly indicated” drug in its class, according to Novo. Ozempic was first approved by the FDA in 2017 to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2D, before being granted expanded approval in 2020 to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with T2D and known heart disease. The FDA’s latest decision on the drug was supported by positive results from the phase 3b FLOW trial, which evaluated a once-weekly 1mg injection of Ozempic on top of standard of care in adults with T2D and CKD. The study met its primary endpoint, with Ozempic demonstrating a 24% relative risk reduction of kidney disease worsening, kidney failure and death due to CVD compared to placebo. Approximately 37 million adults in the US are living with CKD, a progressive condition caused by decreased kidney function. The disease is a common complication of T2D, affecting about 40% of T2D patients. Anna Windle, senior vice president clinical development, medical and regulatory affairs at Novo, said: “CKD is very serious and common in patients living with T2D and represents a critical need for adults living with these comorbidities. “This approval for Ozempic allows us to more broadly address conditions within cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, which affects millions of adults and could have serious consequences if left untreated.” The approval comes just one week after Novo shared positive headline results from a late-stage study evaluating a higher dose of semaglutide in adults with obesity. Among patients who adhered to treatment in the phase 3b STEP UP trial, those receiving the experimental 7.2mg dose of semaglutide achieved a superior weight loss of 20.7% after 72 weeks compared to a reduction of 17.5% with the standard 2.4mg dose, approved under the brand name Wegovy.

FDA Approves Ozempic to Help Cut Risk of Kidney Disease-Related Events,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/fda-approves-ozempic-kidney-disease-diabetes,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Ozempic to help lower risks associated with chronic kidney disease, the drug’s manufacturer Novo Nordisk said on January 28. The blockbuster GLP-1 drug, commonly prescribed off-label for weight loss, was originally approved to treat type 2 diabetes. The new indication for Ozempic adds to a growing number of chronic conditions that can be treated by GLP-1 drugs, in addition to diabetes and obesity. Around 1 in 3 people with diabetes have chronic kidney disease (CKD) caused when high blood sugar levels due to diabetes can damage blood vessels in the kidneys, impairing function over time. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that around 35.5 million people in the United States have CKD. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, can help reduce the risk of kidney disease-related events in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CKD, which could prove invaluable for people living with or at risk for cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, a disorder linking kidney and metabolic issues to heart disease. In May 2024, Novo Nordisk released the full results from its clinical trial, which showed a 24% risk reduction in kidney- and cardiovascular-related mortality from the once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 milligram injection, and an 18% reduced risk of major cardiovascular events. Further, semaglutide reduced the risk of all-cause mortality in trial participants by 20%. “Chronic kidney disease is very serious and common in patients living with type 2 diabetes and represents a critical need for adults living with these comorbidities,” Anna Windle, PhD, senior vice president of clinical development, medical and regulatory affairs at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement. “This approval for Ozempic allows us to more broadly address conditions within cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, which affects millions of adults and could have serious consequences if left untreated.” The results of the FLOW (Evaluate Renal Function with Semaglutide Once Weekly) trial were presented at the 61st European Renal Association Congress in Stockholm last year. Novo Nordisk’s FLOW trial began in 2019 and ended in October 2023, a year earlier than expected due to efficacy. The double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared injectable semaglutide (1.0 mg) with a placebo as an adjunct treatment to standard of care for chronic kidney disease. The trial followed 3,533 people in 28 countries with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe kidney disease. The results demonstrate delayed progression of CKD in the semaglutide group with a 24% reduced risk of death from kidney- and cardiovascular-related complications compared to the placebo group. “The use of semaglutide in people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease can lower the risk of major kidney outcomes and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death and all-cause death,” lead study investigator Prof. Vlado Perkovic, provost at Sydney’s University of New South Wales, who presented the study findings, said in a news release. “These benefits signify a profound clinical impact saving kidneys, hearts and lives, for patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Additionally, the reassuring safety findings further support the strong potential value of semaglutide in this population,” Perkovic added. Dr. Pouya Shafipour, board certified family and obesity medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, told Healthline in an earlier interview he was not surprised by the initial results of the trial, which were shared in March 2024. Shafipour noted recent positive data showing that GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy benefit kidney and heart function in people with type 2 diabetes. “I’ve been prescribing this class of drugs for a few years, and I’ve seen great improvements of diabetes control — they’re really helping with addictive eating behaviors, which helps with weight loss and helps people adhere to a healthy, lower carbohydrate diet,” he said. “With these drugs, if you’re able to reduce unhealthy carbohydrates [and] increase insulin secretion, the metabolism of carbohydrates improves [while] addressing the eating behavior. It’s like a three-in-one mechanism,” he explained, noting how this can improve the health of other systems in the body. Semaglutide is the active ingredient in Ozempic and a type GLP-1 drug. This class of drugs is widely prescribed for obesity and diabetes management for their ability to regulate blood glucose and aid weight loss. Recent studies have shown other health benefits, such as lowered inflammation. All of these factors can impact kidney function in people with diabetes, according to Shafipour. “When blood sugar is chronically elevated — due to a hereditary predisposition, poor eating habits, stress, or sleep and anything that can cause insulin resistance — we start depositing fat in the liver, and everything from head to toe in the body gets sugar-coated, the nerves, eyes, kidney, and stomach,” he said, noting that diabetes can take years to develop. “That’s why in diabetics, it’s very important to have an eye exam, it’s very important to check their kidney function because everything can get impacted by this higher level of glucose.” Shafipour explained that with diabetes, kidney filtration, measured by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), goes down. Then, albumin and protein develop in the urine followed by creatinine in the blood, affecting the body’s metabolization process. “What we’ve seen with this class of drugs is that kidney function in diabetics stabilizes and it prevents progression,” he said. “And if people start losing weight, their blood pressure goes down and the pressure on the kidney goes down. Then the creatinine starts going down again, improving the GFR.” Shafipour noted, however, that people with significant kidney disease or very low GFR may not experience improvement from semaglutide-containing drugs. “I’ve seen prevention of it worsening and improvement in people with [moderate] kidney disease,” he said. The kidneys contain millions of microscopic filters called nephrons. In diabetes, elevated blood sugar levels damage nephrons and blood vessels in the kidneys, impairing function and filtration processes. People with diabetes may also develop high blood pressure, which can lead to kidney damage. “Hypertension by itself is one of the main causes of kidney disease,” Shafipour said. “There’s a lot, again a lot, of other things such as inflammation at stake, probably related to high levels of cortisol inflammatory markers. It’s a very complex process,” he noted. A growing body of evidence shows the potential benefits of Ozempic and similar drugs to treat health conditions beyond obesity and diabetes. In March 2024, Wegovy, Novo Nordisk’s other semaglutide drug, gained FDA approval to help prevent heart disease-related risks like heart attack in people with overweight or obesity. The company is also working to broaden insurance coverage for Wegovy to meet growing demand for the medication. “We already see cardiologists recommending them for people with heart disease, congestive heart failure, etc., because of the positive benefits,” Shafipour said. “There’s a lot of these chronic inflammatory states that cause insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, or metabolic syndrome. We classify all of these into individual conditions and there’s subspecialties for each, but when we really look at the big picture, they’re all related.” The FDA has approved Ozempic to help lower chronic kidney disease-related risks in people with type 2 diabetes. The Novo Nordisk-funded FLOW clinical trial showed that semaglutide delayed the progression of kidney disease-related events in people with diabetes and CKD. The findings of the trial, which ended a year early due to its demonstrated effectiveness, indicate that Ozempic cut the risk of death from kidney and cardiovascular deaths by 24%. The FDA approval of Ozempic to treat chronic kidney disease highlights a growing body of evidence showing that GLP-1 drugs could help treat other health conditions aside from obesity and type 2 diabetes.","comm(FDA)ly comm(FDA)ly commonlynd Drug risks Administrcommonlyti(FDA) Ozempic comm(FDA)ly Administrcommonlyti(FDA) Administrcommonlyti(FDA) (FDA) commonlypproved Ozempic comm(FDA)ly help lower risks comm(FDA)ly risks comm(FDA)ly to help lower risks Administrcommonlyti(FDA) (FDA) commonlypproved Ozempic comm(FDA)ly help Administrcommonlyti(FDA) (FDA) commonlypproved Ozempic comm(FDA)ly help lower risks comm(FDA)ly risks comm(FDA)ly comm(FDA)ly disecommonlyse, the drug’s mcommonlynufcommonlycturer comm(FDA)ly commonlypproved scommonlyid (FDA) risks comm(FDA)ly blockbuster GLP-1 drug, comm(FDA)ly prescribed off-lcommonlybel for weight loss, wcommonlys origincommonlylly Administrcommonlyti(FDA) comm(FDA)ly trecommonlyt type 2 dicommonlybetes. comm(FDA)ly new risks Ozempic commonlydds comm(FDA)ly commonly growing number of Administrcommonlyti(FDA) (FDA) commonlypproved Ozempic comm(FDA)ly help Administrcommonlyti(FDA) (FDA) commonlypproved Ozempic comm(FDA)ly help lower risks comm(FDA)ly risks comm(FDA)ly c(FDA)diti(FDA)s thcommonlyt ccommonlyn be trecommonlyted by GLP-1 blockbuster GLP-1 drug, comm(FDA)ly prescribed off-lcommonlybel for weight loss, wcommonlys origincommonlylly commonlypproved comm(FDA)ly trecommonlyt type 2 dicommonlybetes.

Could FDA's approval of a generic lead to lower cost Ozempic?,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/12/23/fda-generic-approval-lower-cost-ozempic/77174916007/,"In a move that could eventually make weight loss drugs cheaper and easier to access, the Food and Drug Administration Monday approved a second generic in the category of medications known as GLP-1s. The drugs were first approved to treat type 2 diabetes – and that's what the FDA said daily injections of liraglutide could be used for in adults and children 10 and up. The new drug, sold under the name Victoza and made by Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc., follows the approval of the generic GLP-1 exanatide last month, sold under the name Byetta. Neither drug is considered as effective as the brand-name weekly injections sold for diabetes and weight loss as Ozempic and Wegovy by Novo Nordisk and Mounjaro and Zepbound by Eli Lilly. Still, having more options ""could indeed impact the prescribing landscape,"" Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a weight loss specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said via email. But it will depend on the cost of these new drugs, which have not yet been made public. ""Generics typically offer a more affordable option compared to brand-name drugs, which could increase accessibility for patients requiring treatment for type 2 diabetes,"" Cody Stanford said. The list price for Ozempic and Mounjaro each run more than $1,000 a month, which can be difficult to afford, even for people with private insurance, depending on the required copay. Cody Stanford said she hopes lower-priced generics will trigger Novo Nordisk and Lilly to lower the price of their brand-name drugs, and could encourage more insurers to cover GLP-1 medications for both diabetes and weight loss. Providing generics for type 2 diabetes patients might also help reduce demand on the brand-name drugs, making them more available and potentially less expensive for people who need them for weight loss, she said, quickly adding ""though this is speculative and would depend on several market factors."" Liraglutide has been available for years longer than the most popular GLP-1s, but it is less effective and has to be given daily, which might dampen patient interest, she said. ""The market demand is currently for weekly agents with a higher level of efficacy,"" she said. ""So, we must take this into account also."" GLP-1s are a class of drugs that have proven more effective than any previous medications at helping people lose weight safely. They are so effective, suppliers haven't been able to meet demand almost since the FDA approved Ozempic for diabetes in 2017. Last week, the FDA said Lilly had sufficiently met demand for its tirzepatide products, Mounjaro and Zepbound, so they are no longer in short supply ‒ meaning compounding pharmacies will soon have to stop selling cheaper versions of the drugs. In a Monday news release, the FDA said it ""prioritizes assessment of generic drug applications for drugs in shortage to help improve patient access to these medications."" More than 38 million Americans have diabetes, meaning their bodies cannot maintain normal levels of blood sugar. Only 5% to 10% have type 1 diabetes, which is caused by a chronic immune attack on the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes typically develops over time, with diet and lifestyle compounding genetic vulnerability. GLP-1s are helpful for people with diabetes, though they typically lose less weight than people without the disease. Karen Weintraub can be reached at kweintraub@usatoday.com.

Ozempic approved to treat kidney disease by FDA,https://qz.com/the-fda-just-approved-ozempic-for-kidney-disease-1851749815,"Novo Nordisk (NVO+5.33%) announced today that its blockbuster drug Ozempic was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first GLP-1 treatment for chronic kidney disease among people with type 2 diabetes. The popular diabetes drug can now be used to reduce the risk of kidney disease worsening, kidney failure, and death due to heart disease in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. This is latest in a series of FDA-approved uses of GLP-1 drugs, which have become popular for weight loss as well as for conditions associated with diabetes, like sleep apnea. “Chronic kidney disease is very serious and common in patients living with type 2 diabetes and represents a critical need for adults living with these comorbidities,” said Anna Windle, a senior vice president at Novo Nordisk, in a press release. The approval was based on a late-stage clinical trial, which found that a weekly, one-milligram injection of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and the weigh- loss drug Wegovy, was found to reduce the combined risk of major kidney complications (including kidney failure), cardiovascular events, and even death from any cause by 24% in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Novo Nordisk ended the trial early in 2023 after an independent monitoring committee determined that Ozempic’s efficacy in treating chronic kidney disease was clear. The trial followed 3,533 people with kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, half of whom took semaglutide while the other half was given a placebo, for more than three years. Chronic kidney disease is a condition in which the kidney can’t filter blood properly. It affects more than 35.5 million U.S. adults, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 40% of people with type 2 diabeetes also experience chronic kidney disease, according to Novo Nordisk. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

FDA approves weight-loss drug Zepbound for obstructive sleep apnea | CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/20/health/zepbound-sleep-apnea-fda-approval/index.html,"The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the first prescription medicine for obstructive sleep apnea: the weight-loss drug Zepbound. The medicine, part of the class known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that also includes Ozempic, was cleared to treat moderate to severe forms of the sleep condition in people with obesity. It should be used with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, drugmaker Eli Lilly said in a news release. “This is a major step forward for patients with obstructive sleep apnea,” Dr. Sally Seymour, director of the FDA’s Division of Pulmonology, Allergy, and Critical Care, said in the FDA announcement. Obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA, affects as many as 30 million people in the USand is closely associated with obesity, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which notes that weight loss can reduce its severity. It’s characterized by breathing disruptions during sleep caused by blocked airflow and increases the risk of heart and brain problems. Related article Zepbound leads to more weight loss than Wegovy, drugmaker Eli Lilly says “Many cases of OSA go undiagnosed and untreated, leaving millions at risk for serious health consequences,” Patrik Jonsson, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, said in the company’s release. Symptoms include snoring or gasping during sleep and excessive sleepiness in the daytime. Jonsson noted that Lilly’s clinical trials showed that almost half of participants “saw such improvements that they no longer had symptoms associated with OSA.” The approval is the second indication for Zepbound, which was approved for weight loss for those with obesity, or who are overweight and have a weight-related health condition, in November 2023. Although the new FDA green light doesn’t expand the number of people who may be eligible for the drug, since the sleep apnea approval is specifically for people with obesity, it could lead to insurance coverage for those with the condition on Medicare, which doesn’t cover drugs solely for weight loss. Without insurance coverage, Zepbound costs $1,060 per month, but Lilly offers discounts, coupons and a lower-priced version that comes in a vial that patients use a syringe to inject instead of an auto-injector pen. Still, costs can run to hundreds of dollars each month out of pocket. The Biden administration proposed in November to change Medicare’s coverage policy for obesity drugs, but currently, Medicare beneficiaries can get coverage for weight-loss medicines only when they’re used for another indication, like reducing heart risks. The FDA approval for sleep apnea is based on two company-sponsored trials encompassing about 470 participants, one in which patients were being treated with continuous positive air pressure, or CPAP, machines, a mainstay of treatment that helps keep the airway open. Treatment with Zepbound, whose generic name is tirzepatide, led to improvements in both sets of patients, according to results published in June in the New England Journal of Medicine. The trials’ main goal was improvement on a metric known as the apnea-hypopnea index, or AHI, the number of breathing disruptions during an hour of sleep. In both studies, the mean AHI to start was about 50 events per hour, and patients had an average body mass index, or BMI, of about 39; obesity is characterized as a BMI of 30 or more. In the trial in which patients weren’t using CPAP machines, those using Zepbound had about 25 fewer AHI breathing events per hour, on average, after a year of treatment, compared with a reduction of about five for those on a placebo. In the trial in which patients were on CPAP machines, those on Zepbound had about 29 fewer events per hour, compared with about six for those on placebo. Participants on Zepbound also lost significant amounts of weight: about 18% of their body weight, on average, in the first trial and about 20% in the second, compared with 1.6% and 2.3%, respectively, for those on placebo. That equates to 45 to 50 pounds of weight loss, on average, over a year, Lilly said. Patients on the drug also saw reductions in blood pressure and inflammation, “important risk factors for cardiovascular complications of obstructive sleep apnea with obesity,” researchers wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal events, which were typically mild to moderate, the researchers said, and happened most during the time when patients were just starting the medicine or increasing their dose.","Drug sleep apnea: drug drug on Friday drug first sleep apnea: drug Drug Drug Drug sleep apnea: drug sleep apnea: drug drug Zepbound.

"FDA expands Ozempic's use for kidney, heart protection | TechTarget",https://www.techtarget.com/pharmalifesciences/news/366618466/FDA-expands-Ozempics-use-for-kidney-heart-protection,"Ca-ssis/istock via Getty Images Novo Nordisk has secured a key FDA approval for its widely used diabetes drug, Ozempic, i.e., semaglutide. This approval expands its indication to include reducing kidney disease progression, kidney failure and cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. This latest approval strengthens Ozempic's position as the most broadly indicated glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist on the market, highlighting a shift in diabetes treatment beyond blood sugar control. The FDA's decision is backed by data from the FLOW Phase 3b trial, which demonstrated a 24% reduction in the risk of kidney disease worsening, kidney failure and cardiovascular death compared to placebo. With chronic kidney disease (CKD) affecting around 37 million U.S. adults -- 40% of whom also have type 2 diabetes -- this approval addresses a significant unmet need. For the pharmaceutical industry, the move underscores a growing trend toward treating diabetes holistically, factoring in cardiovascular and renal risks rather than focusing solely on glycemic control. The expanded label could shift prescribing patterns, making glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) a key player in managing diabetes-related complications and broadening their use across multiple specialties, including nephrology and cardiology. With this new approval, Novo Nordisk gains a competitive edge in the increasingly crowded GLP-1 RA market. While other drugs in this class have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits, Ozempic is now the only GLP-1 RA with explicit FDA approval for kidney protection in type 2 diabetes patients. This move is likely to put pressure on competitors, particularly Eli Lilly's Mounjaro (tirzepatide), which is being studied for similar benefits. The market for cardiometabolic therapies is evolving rapidly, and pharmaceutical companies will likely accelerate research into additional indications and combination treatments to maintain a competitive edge. Novo Nordisk's expanded indication also raises questions about insurance coverage and reimbursement. Historically, GLP-1 RAs have been covered primarily for diabetes management rather than cardiovascular or renal benefits. However, with growing clinical evidence showing long-term cost savings by preventing complications, insurers might be pushed to reconsider their formularies. The approval could also shift providers' prescribing habits. Nephrologists, who have traditionally relied on sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for kidney protection in diabetes patients, might now consider Ozempic as part of their treatment arsenal. Given the drug's added cardiovascular benefits, cardiologists might also take note. Novo Nordisk's continued push into cardiometabolic care reflects a broader industry trend: As diabetes, kidney disease and cardiovascular issues become increasingly interconnected in treatment paradigms, pharmaceutical companies are likely to invest further in multifunctional therapies. Ozempic's new approval could prompt updates to clinical guidelines and treatment protocols, influencing how diabetes-related kidney disease is managed in both primary care and specialty settings. Real-world data will be key in determining how the drug performs outside clinical trials and whether it influences long-term outcomes for millions of patients. With chronic disease management becoming more integrated, the FDA's latest decision signals a new chapter for GLP-1 RAs.

FDA Approves Ozempic to Reduce Kidney Disease in Type 2 Diabetes,https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/fda-approves-ozempic-to-reduce-kidney-disease-in-type-2-diabetes,"      Chronic kidney disease affects about 37 million adults in the United States and is expected to rise. It is a common complication of type 2 diabetes. The FDA has approved Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic (semaglutide) to reduce the risk of kidney disease worsening, kidney failure, and death due to cardiovascular disease in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Chronic kidney disease affects about 37 million adults in the United States and is expected to rise. It is a common complication of type 2 diabetes, with approximately 40% of people with type 2 diabetes also experiencing CKD. Richard E. Pratley, M.D. “Type 2 diabetes can be challenging enough to manage without the added risk of chronic kidney disease, and I have seen in my own practice that patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease need extra support from medications that may have a profound clinical impact by lowering the risk of major kidney and cardiovascular outcomes,” Richard E. Pratley, M.D., medical director at the AdventHealth Diabetes Institute in Orlando, said in a news release. Th FDA approval is based on results from the FLOW phase 3b kidney outcomes trial investigating the effects of once-weekly Ozempic 1 mg injection on major kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD. The FLOW trial achieved its primary endpoint with Ozempic, with a 24% relative risk reduction of kidney disease worsening, kidney failure (end-stage kidney disease), and death due to cardiovascular disease (4.9% absolute risk reduction at 3 years) compared with placebo, when added to standard of care. Adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation were more common in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group and this was mainly because of gastrointestinal events. Serious adverse events were reported in fewer participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group. Data from the FLOW phase 3b study were presented in June 2024 at the American Diabetes Association and published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The FDA initially approved Ozempic in 2017 to improve blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes. In 2020, Ozempic was granted an additional indication to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, or death in adults with type 2 diabetes with known heart disease. Ozempic has a list price of $997.58 for one pen. Patients with commercial insurance may be eligible to received Ozempic for a copay of $25, but Novo Nordisk indicates in its terms it may limit the assistance if patients are subject to accumulator adjustment or copay maximizer programs.

The agency cited findings from a late-stage trial by Novo Nordisk, which reported in March 2024 that—in a trial of more than 3,500 people with type 2 diabetes—Ozempic lowered the risk of kidney disease progression and death from kidney or cardiovascular complications by 24% compared to a placebo. Patients who used Ozempic also reported slower rates of kidney decline, Novo Nordisk said. The European Union’s health regulators said in December that Novo Nordisk could expand its label for Ozempic, citing the same study, saying the drug could include information about reducing the risk of chronic kidney disease-related events in adults with type 2 diabetes.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about one in every three adults with diabetes have chronic kidney disease. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can cause kidney disease, the agency said, because diabetes can reduce how well kidneys can filter waste. People with diabetes also develop high blood pressure, which can damage the kidneys, according to the CDC. The FDA has approved Ozempic for type 2 diabetes, but it’s also known for its use off-label for weight loss. The agency has authorized Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy—which shares the same active ingredient, semaglutide, as Ozempic—for weight loss and lowering the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attacks or strokes. More studies have been carried out in recent years about the other benefits of drugs like Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy, which belong to a class of medications known as GLP-1 agonists. These drugs mimic the function of a gut hormone involved in regulating blood sugar and appetite, leading to their approval for treating diabetes and obesity. Eli Lilly’s weight-loss drug Zepbound has been approved for treating obesity as well as sleep apnea, after the FDA said the drug resulted in a “statistically significant” reduction in apnea events in a late-stage trial. Some studies suggest GLP-1 could be used to treat alcohol use disorder and boost mood, cognitive function and alleviate symptoms among patients with Parkinson’s, Alzheimer's, dementia, bipolar disorder and anxiety.

New Study Points to Using Ozempic to Treat Addiction | Psychology Today South Africa,https://www.psychologytoday.com/za/blog/navigating-addiction-recovery/202502/new-study-points-to-using-ozempic-to-treat-addiction,"Reviewed by Davia Sills GLP-1 agonist medications such as Ozempic have been game changers in the treatment of obesity and diabetes. Recently, a new study found evidence that Ozempic may be a promising medicine for individuals with alcohol use disorders. This investigation, one of the first clinical trials focused on a population with alcohol use disorders, expands other research exploring the impact of GLP-1 agonists on alcohol and tobacco use among individuals with obesity or diabetes who were being treated with these medications. GLP-1 (also known as glucagon-like peptide 1) is a hormone that is produced by the digestive system and in parts of the brain after we eat. GLP-1 agonist medicines such as Ozempic and Wegovy mimic this hormone’s effects, letting the body know that you’ve eaten enough. The powerful weight loss effects of these medicines have led individuals who take them to achieve a 15 percent reduction in their body weight, on average. Addiction scientists took an interest in GLP-1 agonists after some people who were taking them for weight loss noted that in addition to suppressing their appetite, the medication also seemed to reduce their desire to drink alcohol and/or smoke. Though the reasons these medicines had this effect are not yet well understood, we can make some assumptions based on the way they work on appetite. We know that GLP-1 reduces dopamine (the brain’s pleasure chemical). When a person has food in front of them that they normally really like, such as a piece of cake, without the usual amount of dopamine released, they won’t feel as “excited” in anticipation of enjoying the cake. Without a strong urge, desire, or craving for the cake, they become less likely to want it. If the same process is happening in relation to alcohol and drugs, then GLP-1 agonists may reduce the desire to use them. Research is currently in the early stages. So far, we’ve learned from preliminary study results that those with obesity or diabetes who take GLP-1 agonist medications show reductions in alcohol and tobacco consumption. To date, there have been two randomized clinical trials (this is the “gold standard” type of research study for testing the effectiveness of a drug) evaluating a GLP-1 agonist for treating alcohol use disorder. The first study did not find reductions in heavy alcohol use after 26 weeks of medication treatment, except among those who had both obesity and an alcohol use disorder. The newest study published earlier this month found that among adults with alcohol use disorders, weekly low-dose semaglutide given over 9 weeks effectively reduced alcohol cravings and use when compared to a placebo. Clinical trials evaluating these medicines for tobacco cessation have found mixed results, with one showing positive effects of a GLP-agonist (exenatide) when taken in combination with nicotine replacement therapy and two trials showing no effects. More studies are needed to understand how well these medicines work to reduce alcohol and drug use, for whom they work best, and at what doses. Though more research is needed, the promise of these medicines is important for two reasons: 1. Since GLP-1 agonists act on brain circuits that are generally tied to reward and pleasure, both from food and drugs, it is possible that these medicines may be therapeutic for individuals who are addicted to more than one type of substance (i.e., polysubstance use or addiction). Currently, all the FDA-approved medicines for addictions are for a specific type of substance use disorder, but we don’t have any such options for addictions to multiple substances. 2. The stigma around addiction as a reflection of poor choices or flawed morals remains in our society. The promise of widely used and known medications such as Ozempic as potential treatment options to help people change their use of alcohol and drugs can help shift the conversation about addiction as an illness. This is an essential step towards helping people access much-needed treatments for this condition without shame and stigma as barriers. Based on what is currently known about GLP-1 agonist medications for addiction: 1. Some treatment providers may opt to prescribe them “off-label” to help someone overcome the addiction. Here’s what this means: Though not FDA-approved for this indication, some prescribing healthcare providers may feel that the research to date is compelling enough to warrant the use of these medications to treat addictions. Off-label prescribing is not at all an uncommon practice. The prescriber relies on their clinical judgment, in conjunction with the patient’s willingness to take a medicine that is not FDA-approved for the condition it’s being prescribed for, with a good understanding of the potential risks and benefits of doing so. 2. Research is in the early stages. It is important to be aware of the stage of research we’re currently in with GLP-1 agonists for addiction. With support for accelerated research currently in place from the National Institutes of Health, we are positioned to have scientifically based guidance on their use for addiction treatment a few years from now. In the meantime, we know that these medicines have promise, but we have a limited understanding of their safety, effectiveness, and ideal dosing for individuals with substance use disorders before more randomized clinical trials are conducted. More FDA-approved and unapproved (but promising) medication treatments to address substance misuse and addiction are covered in greater depth in my recently released book, Addiction: What Everyone Needs to Know.","such Sills evidence agonist new new Ozempic new new game new in the evidence of onewsity of dianewtes. new a new by Davia Sills evidence agonist medications for evidence game new found evidence that Ozempic may new a promising medicine for evidence with alcohol use disorders.

The powerful weight loss effects of these medicines new led evidence who take them to achieve a 15 percent reduction in their body weight, on average. Addiction scientists took an interest in evidence agonists after some people who were taking them for weight loss noted that in addition to suppressing their appetite, the medication also seemed to reduce their desire to drink alcohol of/or smoke. Though the renewons these medicines had this effect are not yet well understood, we can make some newsumptions bnewed on the way they work on appetite. We know that evidence reduces dopamine (the brain’s plenewure chemical). When a person hnew food in front of them that they normally really like, such new a piece of cake, without the usual amount of dopamine relenewed, they won’t feel new “excited” in anticipation of enjoying the cake. Without a strong urge, desire, or craving for the cake, they newcome less likely to want it. If the same process is happening in relation to alcohol of drugs, then evidence agonists may reduce the desire to use them. Research is currently in the early stages. So far, we’ve learned from preliminary by Davia Sills evidence agonist medications for evidence game new results that those with onewsity or dianewtes who take evidence agonist medications show reductions in alcohol of tobacco consumption. To date, there new new two rofomized clinical trials (this is the “gold stofard” type of research by Davia Sills evidence agonist medications for evidence game new for testing the effectiveness of a drug) evaluating a evidence agonist for treating alcohol use disorder. The first by Davia Sills evidence agonist medications for evidence game new did not find reductions in heavy alcohol use after 26 weeks of medication evidence, except among those who had both onewsity of an alcohol use disorder. The newest by Davia Sills evidence agonist medications for evidence game new published earlier this month found that among adults with alcohol use disorders, weekly low-dose semaglutide given over 9 weeks effectively reduced alcohol cravings of use when compared to a placebo. Clinical trials evaluating these medicines for tobacco cessation new found mixed results, with one showing positive effects of a GLP-agonist (exenatide) when taken in combination with nicotine replacement therapy of two trials showing no effects. More studies are needed to understof how well these medicines work to reduce alcohol of drug use, for whom they work newst, of at what doses. Though more research is needed, the promise of these medicines is important for two renewons: 1. Since evidence agonists act on brain circuits that are generally tied to reward of plenewure, both from food of drugs, it is possible that these medicines may new therapeutic for evidence who are addicted to more than one type of substance (i.e., polysubstance use or addiction). Currently, all the FDA-approved medicines for addictions are for a specific type of substance use disorder, but we don’t new any such options for addictions to multiple substances. 2. The stigma around addiction new a reflection of poor choices or flawed morals remains in our society. The promise of widely used of known new new Ozempic new potential evidence options to help people change their use of alcohol of drugs can help shift the conversation about addiction new an illness. This is an essential step towards helping people access much-needed evidences for this condition without shame of stigma new barriers. Bnewed on what is currently known about evidence agonist medications for addiction: 1. Some evidence providers may opt to prescrinew them “off-lanewl” to help someone overcome the addiction. Here’s what this means: Though not FDA-approved for this indication, some prescribing healthcare providers may feel that the research to date is compelling enough to warrant the use of these medications to treat addictions. Off-lanewl prescribing is not at all an uncommon practice. The prescrinewr relies on their clinical judgment, in conjunction with the patient’s willingness to take a medicine that is not FDA-approved for the condition it’s newing prescrinewd for, with a good understofing of the potential risks of newnefits of doing so. 2. Research is in the early stages. It is important to new aware of the stage of research we’re currently in with evidence agonists for addiction. With support for accelerated research currently in place from the National Institutes of Health, we are positioned to new scientifically bnewed guidance on their use for addiction evidence a few years from now. In the meantime, we know that these medicines new promise, but we new a limited understofing of their safety, effectiveness, of ideal dosing for evidence with substance use disorders newfore more rofomized clinical trials are conducted. More FDA-approved of unapproved (but promising) medication evidences to address substance misuse of addiction are covered in greater depth in my recently relenewed book, Addiction: What Everyone Needs to Know.","{""Reviewed by Davia"": ""such"", ""been"": ""as"", ""study"": ""by Davia Sills GLP-1 agonist medications such as Ozempic have been game changers"", ""such as Ozempic have been"": ""for individuals"", ""GLP-1"": ""Reviewed by"", ""as"": ""new"", ""changers"": ""new"", ""have"": ""new"", ""be"": ""new"", ""Reviewed by Davia Sills GLP-1 agonist medications such as Ozempic"": ""new"", ""Recently,"": ""new"", ""Sills GLP-1"": ""new"", ""medications such"": ""new"", ""have been"": ""one of"", ""and"": ""of"", ""Reviewed by Davia Sills GLP-1 agonist medications"": ""Reviewed by Davia"", ""Davia Sills GLP-1"": ""Reviewed by Davia"", ""such as"": ""and"", ""treatment"": ""evidence"", ""Reviewed by"": ""evidence"", ""individuals"": ""evidence"", ""Sills GLP-1 agonist medications such"": ""Ozempic may"", ""diabetes."": ""Ozempic may"", ""as Ozempic"": ""Ozempic may"", ""Ozempic have"": ""Ozempic may"", ""Ozempic have been"": ""study"", ""Reviewed"": ""Reviewed""}"
"Novo's Wegovy and Ozempic Removed From US FDA Shortage List, Compounders on Notice",https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2025-02-21/us-fda-says-shortage-of-novos-weight-loss-drug-resolved,"Sections Resources Resources Resources  Novo's Wegovy and Ozempic Removed From US FDA Shortage List, Compounders on Notice Reuters FILE PHOTO: Injection pens and boxes of Novo Nordisk's weight-loss drug Wegovy are shown in this photo illustration in Oslo, Norway, November 21, 2023. REUTERS/Victoria Klesty/Illustration/File Photo By Patrick Wingrove and Bhanvi Satija (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday there was no longer a shortage of Novo Nordisk's popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs, Wegovy and Ozempic, a declaration that will curtail widespread sales of cheaper copies made by compounding pharmacies. Shares of Hims & Hers Health, which advertised its compounded versions of weight-loss drugs during the Super Bowl this month, plunged 22% to $52, on a day it announced the purchase of a plant to make the class of drugs that includes Wegovy and Ozempic. U.S. regulations allow compounding pharmacies to copy brand-name medicines that are in short supply. Wegovy and Ozempic, both known chemically as semaglutide, were in shortage in the U.S. for much of last year. Americans who cannot afford Wegovy or have struggled to find it have been turning to often cheaper versions sold by pharmacies and telehealth providers like Hims & Hers and WeightWatchers. Wegovy has been shown to help patients lose as much as 15% of their weight on average. WeightWatchers shares were up 5.2% at 77 cents. For Hims and other compounders, this development starts the clock on having unfettered market access to Novo's drugs, Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a note. The sale of compounded versions of Eli Lilly's rival obesity and diabetes drugs, Zepbound and Mounjaro, was banned in December after the FDA found them to no longer be in short supply. The FDA said in a statement that compounding pharmacies would be given a grace period of 60 to 90 days, as was the case when Lilly's drugs were declared out of shortage. MORE: Robert Califf, who was FDA commissioner under President Joe Biden, said he did not think the agency's declaration would necessarily end obesity drug compounding. ""There so much money to be made. There's just an endless number of tricks that compounders could use,"" he said in an interview. ""So I don't think it's the end of it, but it certainly will bring us into a new era after the time period has passed and all the lawsuits are finished."" Scott Brunner, CEO of the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, which represents compounding pharmacists and technicians, questioned whether the FDA took into account the number of patients who will need to transition from compounded drugs to FDA-approved versions before making its announcement. The Alliance wrote to the FDA last year, saying more than 200,000 prescriptions for semaglutide drugs not manufactured by Novo Nordisk were being filled by U.S. patients each month, and the agency should consider their role in alleviating the obesity drug supply crunch before barring them. Hims CEO Andrew Dudum said in a posting on X that the company was closely monitoring for potential future shortages of the drugs. Novo said in a statement that the FDA's assessment confirmed that the U.S. supply of its drugs now meets or exceeds current and projected demand. U.S. listed shares of the Danish drugmaker rose 6.2% to $88.93. Novo and Lilly have invested billions to ramp up supply of their treatments, which lagged demand for most of last year. All doses of Ozempic and Wegovy were listed as available on the FDA's website in October, but the treatments had not been taken off the official shortage list at the time. The agency usually assesses if all back orders have been filled before deciding on whether a shortage has been resolved.

"The FDA Approves A New, Non-Opioid Painkiller",https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/fda-approves-new-non-opioid-painkiller-journavx/,"12:10 minutes In January, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new pain medicine called Journavx (suzetrigine), made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals. It’s the first time in 25 years the agency has given the green light to a new painkiller. Notably, it’s not an opioid and, according to the company, it’s not addictive. Unlike opioids, which act directly on the brain, Journavx instead blocks nerve endings across the body that transmit pain. Host Ira Flatow is joined by Dr. Sean Mackey, a professor of anaesthesiology and pain medicine at Stanford University and chief of the Division of Stanford Pain Medicine, to discuss how the new drug works, who should take it, and what its limitations are. Invest in quality science journalism by making a donation to Science Friday. Donate Dr. Sean Mackey is a professor of anesthesiology and pain medicine and Chief of the Division of Stanford Pain Medicine at Stanford University in Stanford, California. IRA FLATOW: This is Science Friday. I’m Ira Flatow. FLORA LICHTMAN: And I’m Flora Lichtman. Later in the hour, why grief can feel like a punch in the gut. And could Uranus and Neptune have deep, multi-layered oceans? IRA FLATOW: But first, last month, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new pain medicine, the first time it’s done so in 25 years. It’s called Journavx, made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals. And the big headline here is that it’s not an opioid, and it’s non-addictive. So how does it work? Who should take it? Does it signal a new era for pain medication? Here to help break down this new painkiller is Dr. Sean Mackey. He’s a Professor of Anesthesiology and Medicine at Stanford and Chief of the Division of Pain Medicine at the university. Dr. Mackey, welcome to Science Friday. SEAN MACKEY: Hey, thanks for having me on board. IRA FLATOW: You’re welcome. OK. In a nutshell, how does this drug work? SEAN MACKEY: Well, in a nutshell, we need to first understand that pain all comes about from signals that are transmitted on nerves, and we have specific types of nerves that will ultimately transmit those pain signals. Now, those signals are generated by an electrical impulse. So when you get an injury, when you undergo surgery, those nerves are stimulated. That stimulation is caused by, in part, sodium channels. So what this particular drug does is it blocks those sodium channels. What’s kind of cool about it is that, as you know, we’ve got nerves all over our body. Our brain, our heart, every organ has got nerves. And the last thing you want to do is give a drug that blocks the nerves that are serving particular vital functions, like our heart beating, like our brain working. What’s cool about this particular drug is it targets only the sensory nerves out in the periphery of our body– specifically, a channel called NaV1.8. Na, If you remember from your high school– IRA FLATOW: Sodium. Na. SEAN MACKEY: Yeah. There you go. Na. It’s sodium. So it’s a particular sodium channel. That’s how it works. IRA FLATOW: I get it. So it stays away from your brain, in other words. SEAN MACKEY: That is the idea of it. And they’ve spent decades, pharmaceutical companies, to try to make this thing happen. And it looks like this company has pulled off a win with it. IRA FLATOW: How is this medication different from an opioid or something like Tylenol? SEAN MACKEY: So this medication works specifically on the peripheral nerves. It targets them, with a laser-type focus on a particular receptor, and blocks it. Opioids, on the other hand, predominantly are working in the spinal cord, the brainstem and the brain, and the central nervous system. And think of them as turning the volume down on pain. So a completely different location for where they’re acting and a completely different mechanism of action. Tylenol– [LAUGHS] we’re still trying to figure out exactly how Tylenol works. We– IRA FLATOW: Really? SEAN MACKEY: –think it works– yeah, after all these years. It is a drug that works also centrally. It works in the brain. And it works by turning down some of these signals, if you will, in the brain. Now you add on the other common drug that we use, which are NSAIDs, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory drugs like the ibuprofens, the Naprosyns, those, interestingly, are not really pain relieving medications per se. They’re not analgesics. Sorry for the jargony word, but what it really means is they reduce inflammation that winds up pain. And so the key is, if you can imagine, once again, our job typically in pain is to attack those pain pathways at different points and ideally identify where the source of the signals are coming from, where the injury is, and go after that specifically with the drug of choice. IRA FLATOW: OK. Now, how effective is it compared to, let’s say, an opioid? And would it be a substitute for it? SEAN MACKEY: Yeah. And that’s a big– that is the big question. What this study showed that they published in the New England Journal of Medicine back in ’23 is that when they compared it against a placebo, that that the highest dose beat placebo statistically. The lower doses did not. They did not, in the paper, make a nice head-to-head comparison against an opioid. And the difference between the drug and placebo was, eh, mild. Rather mild difference. It met statistical significance, but it’s not a hit the ball out of the park major effect. IRA FLATOW: So what’s the big excitement about then, if it’s hardly better than a placebo? SEAN MACKEY: I think the big excitement is, one, this is the first new compound that’s been introduced in decades that gives promise for targeting different pain pathways than what we’ve done before. Two, as has been mentioned, it’s non-addictive. Most likely, there’s no chance that you’re going to get addiction to this particular medication. Three, it does provide some benefit. And remember, when they do these studies, they look at averages of people. The thing is that we don’t treat an average. We treat a person. And so within this study, there was undoubtedly people who got a pretty profound effect, a benefit. And there were others who probably didn’t get much of any. For those people who maybe they shouldn’t be taking an opioid, they’ve had problems with opioids from either side effects or otherwise, this is going to be a nice tool to be able to use. And in addition, the message that we’ve been saying in the pain space for years is there’s probably not a single magic bullet, meaning it’s going to be, if you will, a cocktail of different approaches. So maybe it’s using this drug with another medication where you’re going to get the real big effect sizes. IRA FLATOW: So you’d have to test it out– I don’t mean literally on people, but say, try this, see if it works. SEAN MACKEY: Yeah, I mean, that’s the nature of how we practice pain medicine right now, right? IRA FLATOW: I know. SEAN MACKEY: It’s kind of frustrating for patients and for the docs. IRA FLATOW: Right. But almost it sounds to me like a proof of concept more than anything else. The sodium channels, we can block them, and it works. SEAN MACKEY: Well, first of all, it is a real applicable drug with real utility. And you’re right, it demonstrates a proof of concept that, by targeting a specific type of sodium channel, you can provide pain relief, and it doesn’t look like there’s significant side effects. What I’m particularly hopeful about this medication is that it may provide an additional tool in the future for use in chronic pain conditions. Right now, it’s only FDA approved for acute pain. This drug was studied for post-surgical pain, pain after surgery, but one could also see it being used after trauma. But they do have phase III clinical trials ongoing in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Stay tuned. IRA FLATOW: Stay tuned. And so we should stay tuned not only to see how this works, but what might come after it? Where does the research– I guess, where does it go from here? SEAN MACKEY: Yeah, I think there’s a number of companies out there that are developing new agents that are going to be working in different places along the pain pathways. There’s a company right now that are in late-stage clinical trials focusing on what’s called the TRPV1 receptor, which is the capsaicin receptor. The receptor that causes red hot chili peppers to be hot. IRA FLATOW: Right. SEAN MACKEY: And so they’ve developed a drug that blocks that capsaicin. And it’s injected locally. And they’ve shown some long-term benefit after surgery in providing pain relief. So imagine you start to add a new drug like that, assuming it gets FDA approved, with a sodium channel blocker like this. All of a sudden, you start adding up to some real significant improvements in people’s pain control. IRA FLATOW: Right. We’ve heard about personalized cancer treatment. Are we also talking here, then, personalized pain treatment? SEAN MACKEY: Well, now you’re really talking to me, because this is a big focus of my research and a lot of others in the country, is to advance this notion of personalized pain medicine. So our lab focuses on developing objective biomarkers of pain so that we can ultimately identify the right pain treatment for the right patient and the right circumstance. And you could say that oncology has been our muse. We’ve watched them, for the last several decades, advance this space and do amazing work in personalized cancer care. And we’re all sprinting to try to catch up with what they’ve done in cancer. And I’m particularly optimistic that we’re going to get there. IRA FLATOW: Getting back to this drug here– and I know that you treat patients– do you plan on using this as a clinician? SEAN MACKEY: Yeah, I think the questions for drugs like this are always, how effective is it? And we’ve got one published study showing it’s got mild effectiveness and has some clinical utility. Two, what are its side effects? We spend a lot of time thinking about how drugs are going to impact people. This seems to be pretty mild. And three, cost. So on one hand, if you have a drug that is the same cost as Skittles, well, you’re going to use it a lot. On the other hand, if it’s priced as, say, a chemotherapy infusion, it’s thousands and thousands of dollars, then we’re going to be very selective with it. IRA FLATOW: Yeah. Because as you say, if the studies show it doesn’t work much better than a placebo, then what’s the sense, until you try it out? SEAN MACKEY: Yeah. I think one of the key things to note is this study that was done was done on a few hundred people. It’s also a rather homogeneous set of people. What I mean, it’s almost all women in these studies. We do know there’s sex differences in responses to pain, men and women. We don’t yet know if this will work the same in men as we do in women. It probably will, based on our understanding of the physiology. But until we get it out there and start applying it in thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people, we’re not going to know. We’re also going to, in this process, get a lot more experience with what other potential side effects are. Just take a look at the GLP-1 agents as an example. These are the drugs that cause weight loss. The Ozempic, the drugs that have been used to treat obesity. And people are seeing these used for many other indications. But now, once you expose a public at large numbers, you now start to see potential side effects and the downsides to these medications. And it’s only when you use them in those large numbers that that comes to bear. IRA FLATOW: Very interesting, Dr. Mackey. I want to thank you for taking time to be with us today. SEAN MACKEY: Thank you so much for having me on. IRA FLATOW: And good luck to you in your research. Dr. Sean Mackey, Professor of Anesthesiology and Medicine at Stanford University.

IRA FLATOW: You’re welcome. OK. 12:10 and nutshell, how does this drug work? SEAN MACKEY: Well, Administration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine), and nutshell, we need to first understJandnuandry, thandt Jandnuandry, 12:10 andll comes andbout from signandls thandt andre trandnsmitted on nerves, Jandnuandry, we handve specific types of nerves thandt will ultimandtely trandnsmit those Jandnuandry, 12:10 signandls. Now, those signandls andre generandted by andn electricandl impulse. So when you get andn Administration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),jury, when you undergo surgery, those nerves andre stimulandted. Thandt stimulandtion is candused by, Administration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine), pandrt, sodium chandnnels. So whandt this pandrticulandr drug does is it blocks those sodium chandnnels. Whandt’s kAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),d of cool andbout it is thandt, ands you know, we’ve got nerves andll over our body. Our brandAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),, our heandrt, every organdn hands got nerves.

Nand, If you remember from your high school– IRA FLATOW: Sodium. Nand. SEAN MACKEY: Yeandh. There you go. Nand. It’s sodium. So it’s and pandrticulandr sodium chandnnel. Thandt’s how it works. IRA FLATOW: I get it. So it standys andwandy from your brandAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),, Administration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine), oandpprovedr words.

IRA FLATOW: How is this medicandtion different from andn opioid or somethAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),g like Tylenol?

And it works by turnAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),g down some of andpprovedse signandls, if you will, Administration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine), andpproved brandAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),. Now you anddd on andpproved oandpprovedr common drug thandt we use, which andre NSAIDs, Nonsteroidandl Anti-12:10flandmmandtory drugs like andpproved ibuprofens, andpproved Nandprosyns, those, Administration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),terestAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),gly, andre andpproved reandlly Jandnuandry, 12:10 relievAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),g medicandtions per se.

And so andpproved key is, if you candn imandgAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),e, once andgandAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),, our job typicandlly Administration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine), Jandnuandry, 12:10 is to andttandck those Jandnuandry, 12:10 pandthwandys andt different poAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),ts Jandnuandry, ideandlly identify where andpproved source of andpproved signandls andre comAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),g from, where andpproved Administration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),jury is, Jandnuandry, go andfter thandt specificandlly with andpproved drug of choice. IRA FLATOW: OK. Now, how effective is it compandred to, let’s sandy, andn opioid? And would it be and substitute for it? SEAN MACKEY: Yeandh. And thandt’s and big– thandt is andpproved big question. Whandt this study showed thandt andpprovedy published Administration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine), andpproved New EnglJandnuandry, Journandl of MedicAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),e bandck Administration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine), ’23 is thandt when andpprovedy compandred it andgandAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),st and plandcebo, thandt thandt andpproved highest dose beandt plandcebo standtisticandlly.

It met standtisticandl significandnce, but it’s andpproved and hit andpproved bandll out of andpproved pandrk mandjor effect. IRA FLATOW: So whandt’s andpproved big excitement andbout andpprovedn, if it’s handrdly better thandn and plandcebo? SEAN MACKEY: I thAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),k andpproved big excitement is, one, this is andpproved first 12:10 mAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),utes compound thandt’s been Administration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),troduced Administration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine), decanddes thandt gives promise for tandrgetAdministration Food and Drug Food and Drug Administration approved called Journavx (suzetrigine),g different Jandnuandry, 12:10 pandthwandys thandn whandt we’ve done before.

FDA Approves Ozempic to Protect Kidneys in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes,https://www.pulmonologyadvisor.com/news/fda-approves-ozempic-to-protect-kidneys-in-patients-with-type-2-diabetes/,"HealthDay News —  A popular diabetes drug just got a major new approval — and it could be a game-changer for millions of Americans at risk for kidney failure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has officially approved Ozempic to help reduce the risk of serious kidney complications in people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Type 2 diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease, which affects more than 1 in 7 U.S. adults. The new approval allows doctors to prescribe Ozempic specifically to lower the risk of kidney failure, dialysis and death from heart-related problems in these high-risk patients. “Over the last 20 years, it’s been an area where researchers tried hard but delivered very little,” Dr. Stephen Gough, senior vice president of global medical affairs at Novo Nordisk, the company that makes Ozempic, told The New York Times. “To have something new like this is really exciting, and offers promise to patients.” Doctors already use Ozempic to manage type 2 diabetes and reduce the risk of heart disease in patients with diabetes. This move, as reported by The Times, was based on research showing that people with both type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease who took Ozempic had a 24% lower risk of kidney-related complications, such as needing dialysis or an organ transplant. Patients in the study also had slower rates of kidney decline and were less likely to die from heart problems. “The more we can delay the decline in kidney function, the better,” Dr. Melanie Hoenig, a kidney specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told The Times. Ozempic is often referred to as a “weight loss” drug, but it is not officially approved for that purpose. It is mainly used to control blood sugar, but researchers suspect the drug may also reduce inflammation in the kidneys and throughout the body. Doctors often prescribe medications to lower blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol to help protect the kidneys, but treatment options are still limited. With Ozempic’s approval for kidney disease, though, demand for the drug is expected to grow, and Novo Nordisk has already struggled to keep up. What’s more, the FDA lists semaglutide, the compound in Ozempic and the weight loss drug Wegovy, as currently in shortage. “Many people, unfortunately, cannot get it,” Hoenig told The Times. “But if they can and it works for them, and they can tolerate it, it’s a wonderful thing to have more tools.” More information Learn more about Ozempic on the company website.

Novo Nordisk’s OZEMPIC Approval Heat Up the Chronic Kidney Disease Therapeutic Market | DelveInsight,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novo-nordisk-ozempic-approval-heat-180000312.html,"The FDA’s recent approval of OZEMPIC highlights the expanding use of GLP-1 drugs beyond diabetes and weight management. Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster medication has gained another label expansion, now authorized for treating chronic kidney disease. New York, USA, Feb. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk’s OZEMPIC Approval Heat Up the Chronic Kidney Disease Therapeutic Market | DelveInsight The FDA’s recent approval of OZEMPIC highlights the expanding use of GLP-1 drugs beyond diabetes and weight management. Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster medication has gained another label expansion, now authorized for treating chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition marked by structural or functional kidney impairments lasting more than three months, reducing the kidneys' ability to filter blood efficiently. It is categorized into five stages, with worsening severity potentially resulting in kidney failure (Stage 5) and an elevated risk of cardiovascular complications. If left untreated, CKD can advance to End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD), often requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant. As per DelveInsight analysis, in 2023, approximately 82 million prevalent cases of CKD and nearly 14 million total diagnosed prevalent cases of CKD were diagnosed in the 7MM. These cases are projected to increase further during the forecast period (2025-2034), due to the increasing geriatric population. In 2023, the US accounted for the highest number of diagnosed prevalent cases of CKD among the 7MM, representing approximately 26% of the total diagnosed prevalent cases of CKD. The treatment landscape for CKD comprises various pharmacological therapies designed to manage complications and slow disease progression, though no existing medications can reverse the condition. The CKD treatment market is segmented by drug class, including Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents (ESAs), Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-Is), Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), antidiabetic medications, treatments for Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), and urate-lowering therapies. Several FDA-approved medications play a crucial role in CKD treatment, each offering distinct benefits. FARXIGA (dapagliflozin) and INVOKANA (canagliflozin), both SGLT2 inhibitors, help slow kidney disease progression in adults with or without type 2 diabetes by enhancing urinary glucose excretion through the inhibition of glucose reabsorption. KERENDIA (finerenone), a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), is approved to lower the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, and cardiovascular complications in CKD patients with type 2 diabetes. These treatments reflect an advancing, targeted strategy for CKD management, addressing both renal and cardiovascular health. Learn more about the CKD treatment landscape @ Drugs for Chronic Kidney Disease Treatment Recently in January 2025, the FDA approved Novo Nordisk’s OZEMPIC for chronic kidney disease. The approval of OZEMPIC for chronic kidney disease marks a significant milestone, making it the first GLP-1 receptor agonist indicated for this condition and the most broadly approved drug in its class. Originally authorized in 2017 for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, OZEMPIC received FDA approval in 2020 to lower the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with T2D and established heart disease. Its active ingredient, semaglutide, later expanded into weight management under the brand WEGOVY in 2021, which also gained approval last year for reducing cardiovascular risk. OZEMPIC, available in 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg doses, is an injectable prescription medication designed to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes when combined with diet and exercise. Additionally, it helps lower the risk of serious cardiovascular events—such as heart attack, stroke, or death—in adults with T2D and existing heart disease. The drug also slows the progression of kidney disease, reduces the likelihood of kidney failure (end-stage kidney disease), and decreases the risk of death from cardiovascular disease in adults with T2D and CKD. Its safety and effectiveness in children remain unverified. This FDA approval is backed by the results of the FLOW phase IIIb kidney trial, which assessed the effects of once-weekly OZEMPIC injections on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in adults with T2D and CKD. The study met its primary objective, demonstrating that a 1 mg dose of OZEMPIC reduced the relative risk of kidney disease progression, kidney failure, and cardiovascular-related death by 24% (with an absolute risk reduction of 4.9% over three years) compared to a placebo, alongside standard care. To know more about CKD treatment options, visit @ New Treatment for Chronic Kidney Disease The treatment pipeline for CKD features several promising therapies, including ziltivekimab (Novo Nordisk), zibotentan/dapagliflozin (AstraZeneca), Vicadrostat (BI 690517) + Empagliflozin (Boehringer Ingelheim), Lorundrostat (Mineralys Therapeutics), and others, are currently in advanced development stages. These emerging therapies have the potential to enhance treatment outcomes significantly and fill existing gaps in patient care. Discover which therapies are expected to grab major CKD market share @ Chronic Kidney Disease Market Report Ziltivekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody designed to inhibit IL-6, reducing systemic inflammation linked to atherosclerosis. With an extended half-life, it allows for once-monthly subcutaneous dosing. Currently, in Phase III trials for patients with chronic kidney disease, Ziltivekimab became part of Novo Nordisk’s portfolio after the company acquired Corvidia Therapeutics in June 2020 for USD 2.1 billion. As part of the deal, Novo Nordisk paid USD 725 million upfront, gaining access to Corvidia's lead candidate and strengthening its cardio-renal therapy pipeline. Zibotentan, a potent endothelin A receptor antagonist, is being combined with dapagliflozin, a powerful SGLT2 inhibitor, to form a synergistic treatment for CKD with high proteinuria. This combination is designed to enhance kidney protection, lower proteinuria levels, and offer cardiovascular benefits by targeting key disease mechanisms, potentially reducing mortality and delaying the progression to ESKD. Currently in Phase III trials, the therapy showed promising outcomes at ASN 2023, with Phase IIb data revealing a significant reduction in albuminuria compared to dapagliflozin alone, further supporting its continued development for CKD patients with high proteinuria. These findings were simultaneously published in The Lancet. BI 690517, developed by Boehringer Ingelheim, is an innovative and highly selective aldosterone synthase inhibitor (ASi) aimed at slowing kidney damage progression and lowering cardiovascular risks in CKD patients. Currently undergoing evaluation in the Phase III EASi-KIDNEY trial, it is being tested alongside empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, to enhance renal protection. In November 2023, Boehringer Ingelheim presented promising Phase II results at ASN Kidney Week, highlighting BI 690517 as a potentially significant treatment for CKD. The drug received Fast Track Designation from the US FDA in October 2022. Discover more about drugs for CKD in development @ Chronic Kidney Disease Clinical Trials The anticipated launch of these emerging therapies for CKD are poised to transform the market landscape in the coming years.

Ozempic Side Effects - Ozempic helps people fight urge to drink alcohol in new study - India Today,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/shows/story/the-buzz-ozempic-helps-people-fight-urge-to-drink-alcohol-in-new-study-glbs-2680711-2025-02-16,"Listen to Story A new government-funded study suggests that medications transforming obesity treatment may also help people reduce alcohol consumption. Although the study was small—just 48 adults over two months—experts find the results promising. However, the safety of these drugs for individuals who don’t need to lose weight remains unclear. Drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, mimic gut and brain hormones to regulate appetite. Emerging evidence suggests they may also reduce cravings for alcohol, tobacco, and other addictive substances. “This is such promising data, and we need more of it,” said study co-author Dr. Klara Klein of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “We frequently hear that once people start these medications, their desire to drink is significantly reduced, if not eliminated.” The research, published in JAMA Psychiatry, was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Study details & findings The study involved adults with symptoms of alcohol use disorder who weren’t actively seeking treatment. Initially, participants were given their favourite alcoholic beverage in a lab setting and could drink freely for two hours. Researchers then divided them into two groups: one received weekly semaglutide injections, while the other received a placebo. For nine weeks, participants tracked their drinking habits and cravings, followed by another lab session where they consumed alcohol. Key findings: Nearly 40% of the semaglutide group reported no heavy drinking days, compared to 20% in the placebo group. During the final lab test, those on semaglutide drank about half as much as the placebo group. Notably, some smokers in the semaglutide group also reduced cigarette consumption, suggesting broader addiction-related benefits. Caution & Future Research While the findings are encouraging, larger clinical trials are needed to confirm the results. Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, an NIH researcher, is leading a 20-week trial on semaglutide for alcohol use disorder in Baltimore. “There are already three approved medications for alcohol use disorder,” said lead author Christian Hendershot of the University of Southern California. “Until larger studies confirm these findings, people should consult their doctor about existing treatments.” The study primarily involved overweight individuals, leaving questions about the drug’s safety for those with normal weight. Researchers continue to explore the effects of GLP-1 drugs on addiction, including opioid and cocaine use.

"Serious Ozempic Side Effects, Confirmed: Here’s What to Know",https://www.aol.com/serious-ozempic-side-effects-confirmed-150000655.html,"""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."" Most people know that GLP-1 receptor agonist medications like Ozempic and Wegovy can cause relatively minor side effects like nausea and diarrhea. But new research confirms that more serious complications—like pancreatitis and kidney damage—are real. It's important to point out that most people who use GLP-1 receptor agonist medications do not experience these side effects. But, of course, you should be aware of all potential risks before using a medication. Here’s what the study suggests, plus what a weight loss physician wants you to know. Meet the expert: Mir Ali, MD, is the medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. The study, which was published in Nature Medicine on January 20, analyzed data from more than 2 million people with diabetes who took GLP-1 receptor agonist medications like Ozempic and Wegovy. The researchers found that these medications helped lower the risk of developing 42 different health conditions or outcomes, including dementia, cardiac arrest, and certain kinds of cancer. But they also discovered that people who took these medications had a higher risk of developing 19 different negative health outcomes. Those included nausea and vomiting, kidney stones, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), sleep issues, stomach cramps, pancreatitis, and gastroparesis (i.e. stomach paralysis). These findings are “consistent with other studies previously done,” says Mir Ali, MD, the medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. The risk of developing both of these conditions while taking a GLP-1 receptor agonist medication is low. But research has generally shown that the risk of developing pancreatitis while taking this medication is less than one percent. Reports of kidney damage have largely been limited to case reports, suggesting they’re extremely rare. Of course, it’s possible to have side effects on Ozempic without becoming seriously ill. According to the Ozempic website, more common side effects include: Nausea Diarrhea Constipation Stomach pain Vomiting Everyone reacts to these medications differently, Ali says. However, he says you can often lower your risk of side effects by staying well hydrated, eating smaller meals, and limiting processed foods, high-fat foods, and refined carbohydrates. Another thing to keep in mind: Side effects, if you do experience them, tend to ease in a few weeks when your body gets used to the medication, per Ali. “I do believe the benefits outweigh the risks; although gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, diarrhea or constipation are common, they are manageable, for the most part,” Ali says. “More serious side effects like pancreatitis and kidney complications are very rare.” You Might Also Like Can Apple Cider Vinegar Lead to Weight Loss?

Is Ozempic Truly A ‘Miracle Drug’ For Weight Loss? Understanding The Safety And Effectiveness Concerns | OnlyMyHealth,https://www.onlymyhealth.com/is-ozempic-truly-a-miracle-drug-for-weight-loss-12977823842,"Ozempic is currently one of the most popular drugs on the market, with many Hollywood as well as Bollywood celebs allegedly using it to lose weight. Recently on Christmas, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to post his ""Ozempic Santa"" look. However, in a follow-up post, Musk clarified that he's actually taking Mounjaro, which is similar to Ozempic. Regardless of which brand of semaglutide the celebs are taking, it is important to address the risks and safety concerns that people have around the so-called 'miracle' weight loss drug. One must understand that shortcuts to a healthy lifestyle is never a long-term solution, but an addition to the already existing health problems. To tackle the same, Onlymyhealth spoke to two endocrinologists to understand the role of Ozempic, whether or not it can be taken to lose weight, and the potential risks and side effects that can follow after the drug's usage. Also Read: Can Ozempic Lead To Hair Loss? Hear It From The Expert  Ozempic, also known as semaglutide, is an anti-diabetic medication that was launched by Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company, back in 2017. While its primary use is to help improve blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes, it has gained a lot of popularity for its weight loss effects. The medication is an injectable that is administered once every week under the skin of the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm, according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dr Mahesh D M, Consultant Endocrinologist, Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru, said, ""Ozempic functions as a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, which not only helps lower blood sugar levels but also plays a significant role in weight management, making it a dual-purpose solution for those struggling with diabetes and obesity."" Ozempic works by acting like natural hormones (GLP-1) in your body. It helps release more insulin after you eat, reduce your appetite, and slow down how quickly food leaves your stomach. These combined effects help control blood sugar and lead to weight loss, the doctor simplified.  Although Ozempic has gained much popularity for its weight-loss benefits, particularly among those with obesity, Dr Satyam Chakraborty, Consultant Endocrinologist, Fortis Hospital, Anandapur, clarified that it is not a 'magic solution.' When asked how the anti-diabetic medication promotes weight loss, he answered, “Ozempic decreases appetite and increases feelings of fullness, making it easier to eat less and lose weight. Unlike other weight-loss medications, Ozempic also improves insulin sensitivity, reduces inflammation, and slows down digestion, leading to more sustainable weight loss.” A 2022 study published in the JAMA Network Open examined the effectiveness of semaglutide for weight loss in 175 overweight or obese patients. After three months, researchers found that participants lost 6.7 kilos. After six months, in the 102 patients who continued follow-up, the average weight loss increased to 12.3 kg. However, Dr Chakraborty noted that sustainable weight loss requires a combination of healthy lifestyle habits, including a balanced diet and regular exercise. Dr Mahesh added that while Ozempic has garnered significant attention for its potential to aid in weight loss, it is essential to explore the broader landscape of weight management solutions. “Many individuals may find that alternative methods, such as lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, and other medications, can provide safer and more sustainable results without the potential side effects associated with Ozempic. By examining all available options, individuals can make informed decisions that align with their health goals and ensure a more holistic approach to weight management,” he said. Also Read: Adult Obesity Rates In US Drop for the First Time in Over a Decade  Ozempic is primarily prescribed for managing type 2 diabetes; however, its off-label use among non-diabetic individuals raises important safety concerns, according to Dr Mahesh. As per the FDA, Ozempic may cause serious side effects, including low blood sugar, inflammation of the pancreas, complications of diabetes-related retina disease (diabetic retinopathy), and allergic reactions. The most common side effects in clinical trials included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and constipation. More serious risks include pancreatitis, thyroid tumours, and allergic reactions. It's essential to note that Ozempic is not approved for everyone, particularly those with:  Type 1 diabetes Pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer Thyroid cancer or tumours Severe gastrointestinal disease Pregnancy or breastfeeding  Ozempic In India Ozempic is not officially available in India and is not approved for use in India. While the demand for Ozempic is high, the supply is limited. ""As of now, Ozempic, which is primarily approved for the management of type 2 diabetes, has not received specific regulatory approval for weight loss in India,"" said Dr Mahesh, adding, however, that the growing awareness of its potential benefits for weight management has led to discussions among healthcare professionals and patients alike. ""While it may be accessible through certain channels, individuals seeking Ozempic for weight loss should consult with a healthcare provider to understand the implications, potential off-label use, and the best course of action tailored to their health needs,"" the doctor advised.[Disclaimer: This article contains information provided by an expert and is for informational purposes only.

"Ozempic and Wegovy may boost health, from addiction to dementia",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d5pq4y5wpo,"The first study to assess how weight-loss drugs affect the whole of human health has discovered an ""eye-opening"" impact on the body, researchers say. The analysis, involving about two million people, linked the drugs to better heart health, fewer infections, a lower risk of drug abuse and fewer cases of dementia. The US researchers also warned the drugs were ""not without risk"" and seemed to increase joint pain and potentially deadly inflammation in the pancreas. However, the results need very careful interpretation. Weight-loss drugs have exploded in popularity - but a full understanding of everything they touch in the body is still coming together. ""This is new territory,"" said lead researcher Dr Ziyad al-Aly, clinical epidemiologist at Washington University. Initially, they were a proven treatment for type 2 diabetes. Then, weight loss was noticed as a significant side-effect - and Ozempic and Wegovy became household names. The study used data on US veterans with type 2 diabetes, some of whom were given Ozempic or Wegovy and some more standard drugs - to measure their effect on 175 other illnesses. There appeared to be a significant boon to heart health, with lower levels of heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and high blood pressure, in those taking the new weight-loss drugs. They also cut the risk of substance abuse (including alcohol, opioids and cannabis) as well as reducing schizophrenia, suicidal thoughts and seizures. Despite the study being short, and people taking the drugs for only 3.5 years because of how new they are, it reported a 12% reduction in Alzheimer's disease. There was also less liver cancer, muscle pain and chronic kidney disease as well as a noted reduction in bacterial infections and fever. On the flip side, people were more likely to have problems in their digestive system. Feeling sick, tummy pain, inflammation in the stomach, diverticulitis (bulges in the intestines that can be painful) and haemorrhoids were more common on Ozempic or Wegovy. The data, published in the journal Nature Medicine, also showed low blood pressure, including fainting, headaches, disturbed sleep, kidney stones, inflammation in the kidneys and a range of bone or joint pains, including arthritis, became more frequent. ""It was definitely eye-opening for me to see all these different hits in different organ systems,"" Dr Aly told BBC News. The explanations for the drugs' seemingly wide-ranging impact are both obvious and mysterious. Losing excess weight would in turn improve health. For example, lower levels of sleep apnoea – when breathing stops and starts while slumbering  – is thought to be down to losing weight around the tongue and throat, which can block the airways. But the drugs also appear to be directly altering the behaviour of cells and tissues in the body. Dr Aly said: ""Obesity is bad for the brain. Obesity is bad for mental health. Obesity is bad for the heart. Obesity could be the mother of all ills."" Ozempic and Wegovy have the same active ingredient, semaglutide, in different doses, and mimic the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1. Released by the gut after eating, GLP-1 travels through the blood and sticks to little receptors on the surface of brains cells. This tells the brain there is food in the stomach and is why people feel less hungry after eating. However, receptors that respond to GLP-1 are found throughout the body, including in the heart and some parts of the immune system. ""It is very clear this class of drugs seem to suppress reward mechanisms [in the brain so it] inhibits that urge to seek out alcohol, to seek out tobacco, to seek out gambling,"" Dr Aly said. Meanwhile, lower levels of inflammation, the alarm bell of the immune system, could have a wide range of health impacts. The range of health benefits may strengthen the case for some people using the drugs, Dr Aly said. ""When you add more benefit, for the people who really are at risk of these conditions, that's an added plus,"" he said. But for those whose weight is not affecting their health, ""maybe the risk that they're buying themselves is actually much higher than the benefit"". However, the study has drawbacks that limit its findings. Most of the veterans were white men, so it did not include any female-specific effects, such as the anecdotal phenomenon of improved fertility and unexpected ""Ozempic babies"". And there could be reasons why some had been prescribed Ozempic or Weygovy, rather than other drugs, that could provide alternative explanations for some of the findings. Thorough clinical trials have already proven benefits to heart health - and nausea is a known side-effect - but other findings will need to go through similar rigorous testing. Alzheimer's starts more than a decade before symptoms appear - but this study suggests just a few years on semaglutide has a protective effect. Trials are already under way to work out if this effect is real. ""Such trials will lead us much closer to the truth,"" Prof Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow, said. ""Fortunately… several will report out in the next one to four years."" And while ""interesting"", he said this latest study's findings were not strong enough to influence how the drugs were prescribed. Prof Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, from the University of Cambridge, said the study needed to be interpreted ""carefully"" but provided ""useful reassurance"" about the drugs' safety in people with diabetes. And further studies in other patients were ""awaited with interest"". The ""most surprising finding"" was the increase in joint pain, since weight loss should reduce pressure on the joints. But the fact some cells in the immune system had GLP-1 receptors meant the impact of these drugs was ""somewhat unpredictable"" and while some inflammatory disorders may be eased, ""others might conceivably be exacerbated"", Prof O'Rahilly said.","an ""eye-opening"" discovered assess how weight-loss drugs an discovered assess on researchers say.

Can Ozempic help curb alcohol cravings? - India Today,https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/can-ozempic-curb-alcohol-cravings-new-study-2680146-2025-02-15,"Listen to Story Researchers have found a rather helpful side effect of Ozempic and similar drugs: they could be effective in controlling alcohol overconsumption. A new study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry found that semaglutide (sold under brand names Mounjaro, Ozempic, Rybelsus, and Wegovy) can help curb alcohol cravings. The clinical trial, however, comprised only 48 participants and was conducted over a span of nine weeks. The chosen participants already dealt with alcohol use disorder (AUD) - a condition that makes it difficult to control alcohol consumption. The female participants reported drinking more than seven drinks a week, while male participants consumed 14 within the month prior. They also reported two or more heavy drinking days (five drinks at a time for men and four drinks for women). During the trial, half of the patients received low doses of semaglutide on a weekly basis, while the other half received a placebo. Participants in the semaglutide group experienced nearly a 30 per cent reduction in the quantity of alcohol consumed on drinking days by the second month of treatment. In contrast, the placebo group saw only about a 2 per cent reduction during the same period. Moreover, 40 per cent of the participants in the semaglutide group reported having 'no heavy drinking days', compared to 20 per cent in the placebo group. However, it was observed that semaglutide did not affect the number of days people consumed alcohol; only the amount consumed was less. The trial found that semaglutide didn’t appear to affect how many days out of the week people chose to drink alcohol - just that when they drank, they drank less. One cannot ignore the several limitations of the new study as well. For instance, researchers are yet to determine exactly how semaglutide reduces alcohol cravings. Is it due to common side effects like nausea, which naturally discourages drinking? Or does the drug alter brain activity and make alcohol less appealing, similar to its effect on food? Additionally, the study did not include participants without excess body weight. Only one of the participants had a BMI under 24.9 (25 to 29 is considered overweight, and 30 onwards is obese); thus, whether semaglutide should be used in people without weight issues is still a question. It is also yet to be studied what happens to a person with alcohol use disorder once they stop taking the drug. Bigger trials over a longer period are certainly required to assess if (and how) semaglutide can actually help with alcohol addiction. Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist drug, was originally developed as an anti-diabetic medication. It has now gained popularity for its significant results for weight loss. It mimics the action of the enzyme GLP-1 and reduces appetite via brain pathways and slowing gastric emptying of food into the intestine. This promotes a feeling of early fullness and hence leads to reduced calorie intake and subsequent weight loss. As it continues to make global buzz as a miracle medication for its dual benefit - insulin production and significant weight loss - several side effects (some rather surprising) have emerged. Minor symptoms include nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and upper abdominal pain. Some severe side effects can lead to vision issues, pancreatitis, stomach paralysis, gallbladder issues, and allergic reactions. Some patients may also face ileus (a condition where intestines are no longer able to contract, hence waste is not able to move out of the body). In terms of surprising effects, people have reported increased fertility (as suggested by the Ozempic baby boom) and delayed ageing.Published By: Medha ChawlaPublished On: Feb 15, 2025Trending Reel","Listen Ozempic SOzempicry ReseListen to Story Researchers have found a rastudyr helpful siderchers ReseListen to Story Researchers have found a rastudyr helpful siderchers hListen to Story Researchers have found a rastudyr helpful sideve found Listen to Story Researchers have found a rastudyr helpful side Listen Ozempic SOzempicry ReseListen to Story Researchers have found a rastudyr helpful siderchers Ozempic drugs: hListen to Story Researchers have found a rastudyr helpful sideve found Listen to Story Researchers have found a rastudyr helpful side Listen Ozempic SOzempicry ReseListen to Story Researchers have found a rastudyr helpful siderchers effect of Ozempic Listen to Story Researchers have found a rastudyr helpful sidend similListen to Story Researchers have found a rastudyr helpful sider drugs: studyy study be hListen to Story Researchers have found a rastudyr helpful sideve found Listen to Story Researchers have found a rastudyr helpful side rListen to Story Researchers have found a rastudyr helpful sidestudyr Listen to Story Researchers have found a rastudyr helpful sidelcohol overconsumption.

Vision loss: GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic linked to 3 eye conditions,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/review-3-potentially-blinding-eye-conditions-glp-1-drugs-ozempic-mounjaro,"As interest in taking glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 agonist) medications, such as Zepbound and Wegovy, for weight loss, research continues to examine potential new side effects of these types of drugs. In July 2024, a study published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology found a potential link between semaglutide — the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic — and a rare eye condition called nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Now, a new investigatory review just published in JAMA Ophthalmology reports nine people taking semaglutide and tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro — experienced vision issues, including NAION, as well as two other potentially blinding eye conditions. According to Bradley Katz, MD, PhD, an ophthalmologist at the John A. Moran Eye Center and professor in the Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences at the University of Utah and lead author of this study, it’s important for researchers to continue to examine how GLP-1 medications might impact other areas of a person’s health. “Between 2-3% of the U.S. population received a prescription for one of these medications in 2023,” Katz told Medical News Today. “Because so many people are using these medications it’s critical to monitor any ill effects on the eye or other parts of the body.” For this investigative study, Katz and his team focused on nine patients with an average age of about 58, with five females and four males. Seven of the study participants developed NAION, which Katz explained is a stroke of the optic nerve — the nerve that connects your eye to your brain — potentially causing irreversible vision loss in one or both eyes. “One (participant) developed a stroke in the retina — this is the part of your eye that absorbs light and turns it into an electrical signal for your brain,” he continued. “This stroke also causes irreversible loss of vision in one eye.” “The ninth patient developed swelling in both optic nerves but did not lose vision,” Katz added. While it is still unclear as to what may cause a person taking a GLP-1 medication to experience an eye issue, researchers hypothesize that rapid changes in blood sugar levels might contribute to these eye complications. “These drugs are very effective at reducing blood sugar and when one rapidly reduces blood sugar it can cause swelling in the optic nerve,” Katz explained. “It can also temporarily worsen diabetic eye changes. How it causes swelling is thought to be due an osmotic shift. When there’s more ‘stuff’ in your blood — in this case sugar — and you suddenly reduce the amount of stuff in the blood, it causes rapid shifts in fluid between blood vessels and cells in the eye,” he said. Katz also stated that they are not recommending anyone stop using GLP-1 drugs or not use these drugs if they’re recommended by their doctor. “What we are recommending is that if you experience a change in your vision while using one of these drugs, you should consult the prescribing doctor and see an ophthalmologist. We are also recommending that if patients are starting these drugs or increasing the dose of these drugs, they should do so slowly to reduce the risk of dropping their blood sugar and causing an osmotic shift.”— Bradley Katz, MD, PhD “We as well as other concerned physicians are also asking FDA to mandate a post-marketing survey of these drugs to find the true incidence of eye complications associated with them. We are in discussions with other groups around the U.S. who want to do a more comprehensive review of these medications and potential ocular side effects,” Katz added. MNT had the opportunity to speak with Mir Ali, MD, a board certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. “This seems to be a rare and unusual complication of GLP-1 medication use, as millions of people have been using these types of medications for many years,” Ali commented. “Since this is so rare a complication, in so few patients, it is difficult to delineate the exact mechanism; I really can’t comment on why this would happen.” “As with all medications, if a patient notices a significant change in vision, or any other system, they should contact their prescribing provider. Since there is widespread use of these medications, it is important for people to be aware of all potential side effects and complications. However, since eye problems are very rare, it probably would not impact the frequency people on these medications should have their eyes examined.”— Mir Ali, MD “As with all research, finding a greater sample of people affected by these conditions using GLP-1 medications may help to identify risk factors for these types of problems,” Ali added. ”If a risk factor for eye problems is identified, and someone has these factors, then it may be a reason for a person to avoid these medications.” MNT also spoke with Howard Krauss, MD, surgical neuro-ophthalmologist and director of Pacific Neuroscience Institute’s Eye, Ear & Skull Base Center at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, about this study. “The proposed mechanisms of ‘injury’ put forward by the authors are worthy of investigation,” Krauss said. “Frequent — at least annual — eye exams for those with underlying diseases which carry risk of adverse ocular sequelae, even in the absence of ocular or visual symptoms, are to be recommended.” “Those who wish to take an extra step of caution, may choose to have an eye exam prior to initiating treatment to determine their ocular health status and to query if they may have a ‘disc-at-risk,’ in that the large majority of those who may acquire NAION have a c/d ratio less than or equal to 0.3,” Krauss added. In eye exams, healthcare professionals use the c/d ratio, also known as the cup-to-disc ratio, to assess the health of the optic nerve. A lower ratio in people who use GLP-1 medications may point to a higher risk of developing NAION, which affects blood flow to the optic nerve. “Additionally, assessment and control of other risk factors (e.g., sleep apnea) may be considered prior to or concurrent with initiation of semaglutide or tirzepatide treatment,” Krauss added.","As Asterest As takAsg As As recepnewr As (GLP-1 medications, such such new Zepbound In Wegovy, such new Zepbound In new contAsues new As potential new (GLP-1 As medications, such new Zepbound In Wegovy, for Asterest loss, As takAsg As As recepnewr As (GLP-1 As medications, such new Zepbound In Wegovy, for Asterest loss, types As drugs. of potential As a study such new Zepbound In As potential journal Ophthalmology found found a potential lAsk between semaglutide — potential active Asgredient As Wegovy In Ozempic — In a rare eye condition called nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). of a new Asvestiganewry review just such new Zepbound In As Ophthalmology found reports nAse people takAsg semaglutide In tirzepatide — potential active Asgredient As Zepbound In Mounjaro — experienced vision issues, AscludAsg NAION, new well new two opotentialr potentially blAsdAsg eye conditions.

Ozempic Side Effects in Females vs. Males,https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/ozempic-side-effects-in-females,"Side effects of Ozempic seem to be similar in males and females. Some evidence suggests that females may be more likely to have side effects from GLP-1 agonists, but this hasn’t been specifically shown with Ozempic. Ozempic (semaglutide) is a prescription injection that’s FDA-approved for: Ozempic may also be prescribed off-label for weight loss. (With off-label use, a drug is prescribed for a purpose other than what it’s approved for.) Several studies examining Ozempic’s side effects mostly involved female participants. Some of the most common side effects reported in these studies included nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Read on to learn more about Ozempic side effects in females. Note: In this article, we use the term ”male/female” to refer to someone’s sex assigned at birth. For information about the difference between sex and gender, see this article. Limited evidence suggests that certain side effects of Ozempic are more common in females than males. Several studies that examined the rates of side effects with Ozempic have mostly included female participants. Ozempic belongs to a drug class called glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) receptor agonists. In a 2020 study from South Korea, females using other GLP-1 receptor agonists (but not Ozempic) reported having side effects more than twice as often as males. This may be partially due to females being more likely to have gastrointestinal (digestive) conditions in general. Females in this study reported: In a 2022 study involving 175 people using semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic), the following side effects were commonly reported. About 75% of the people in the study were female. In another 2022 study, the effectiveness of semaglutide for weight loss was compared with that of a placebo. Nearly 80% of the 304 study participants were female. The table below includes examples of side effects that were more common among people using semaglutide than those using a placebo in the study. There aren’t enough studies to know whether Ozempic is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Animal studies suggest that there may be some risk to the animal fetus if Ozempic is used during pregnancy. Because of this, if you’re planning a pregnancy, doctors would likely recommend you stop using Ozempic 2 months before becoming pregnant. “Ozempic face” is an informal term that refers to the facial appearance of some people using Ozempic who lose weight rapidly. This rapid weight loss can cause: It’s not clear if females are more likely to develop “Ozempic face,” but there’s some evidence that females might have more pronounced weight loss when using GLP-1 receptor agonists than males. Learn more about how Ozempic affects your face. Acute pancreatitis is the sudden swelling of your pancreas. It’s a rare but serious side effect of Ozempic that has been reported in studies. It’s not clear whether pancreatitis occurs more often in females. Symptoms of acute pancreatitis include: Most side effects from Ozempic go away within days to weeks of stopping treatment or having your dose reduced. It’s not clear whether long-term side effects from Ozempic are more common in females than in males. Semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic) has been linked to some long-term side effects. These include: There are concerns that Ozempic might make oral birth control pills less effective. Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonists may slow down stomach emptying and affect how consistently birth control pills are absorbed. Animal studies suggest that semaglutide may affect the reproductive cycle, which could affect how well birth control pills work. But at this time, there is no specific evidence that shows Ozempic affects birth control. Learn more about Ozempic and birth control. Ozempic is a prescription injection that’s FDA-approved for use in adults with type 2 diabetes. It’s also prescribed off-label for weight loss. The drug belongs to a drug class called GLP-1 receptor agonists. Some evidence suggests that females may be more likely to have side effects than males when using GLP-1 agonists, but this hasn’t been specifically shown with Ozempic. More extensive research will help determine whether Ozempic is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding. If you’re planning a pregnancy, your doctor may likely recommend you stop using Ozempic.

"GLP-1 Drugs for Older Adults: Risks, Side Effects, and Safe Weight Loss",https://www.everydayhealth.com/obesity/what-older-adults-need-to-know-before-taking-a-glp-1-like-ozempic/,"[1] While a lifeline for many, these medications aren’t for everyone. In particular, people age 65 and older may be susceptible to distinct risks — including muscle mass loss — when taking GLP-1s and similar drugs. Here’s what older adults and their loved ones need to know about the potential advantages and drawbacks of GLP-1s. Originally designed to treat type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 drugs work by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide 1, which prompts the pancreas to make more insulin after meals. The extra insulin helps regulate blood sugar, but the drugs can also reduce appetite and slow the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine, helping people feel full faster, which can promote weight loss. But one thing to keep in mind is that losing weight, particularly in a rapid manner, can also lead to muscle and bone loss, says John Batsis, MD, an associate professor of medicine in the department of geriatric medicine at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and an American Board of Obesity Medicine (ABOM) diplomate. [2] [3] [4] [5] Muscle and bone loss can impede older adults’ physical function and ability to live independently, Dr. Batsis says. “Both muscle mass and strength impact muscle quality, which is key to ensuring individuals can conduct their daily activities,” he says. “Losing muscle mass and strength can lead to sarcopenia [age-related involuntary muscle loss], which increases the risk for functional decline, disability, nursing home placement, and death.” [6] Strength training and a protein-rich diet can help reduce loss of muscle and bone, but shedding pounds quickly may inhibit the body’s ability to adjust, Batsis notes. Of course, obesity can also hinder older adults’ health and quality of life, but Batsis says there’s a “fine balance” to strike when it comes to weight loss. Further research on the effects of GLP-1s on older adults could help healthcare providers and patients achieve that balance more effectively. [7] [8] “Severe gastrointestinal side effects from these drugs may lead to dehydration, which can lead to falls,” Batsis says. “When a person becomes dehydrated, they are more inclined to become dizzy or feel faint and fall.” This is why it’s important to monitor older people taking weight loss medications to ensure they get enough food and water. [7] [9] While GLP-1s and similar medications can be effective tools to help people manage type 2 diabetes and obesity, they’re not enough on their own, nor are they one-size-fits-all, says Kristen Smith, RDN, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, who is based in Atlanta. In order to ensure healthful, sustainable results, it’s important to also adopt healthy habits, including eating a balanced diet and staying physically active, adds Shayna Oshita, PhD, RD, CDCES, a dietitian and diabetes educator at the University of Illinois in Chicago. “There is no magic pill for weight loss, and without proper education on practical lifestyle modifications, patients on these medications will not be successful long term,” says Dana Angelo White, RDN, a dietitian and certified athletic trainer in private practice in Fairfield, Connecticut. “Weight loss is not just about the number on the scale — the type of weight lost and the nutrient deficiencies that may occur as a result of appetite suppression can pose serious health risks.” Smith says that working closely with a healthcare team is essential for people who use the medications to ensure safety and efficacy. Additionally, Oshita, Angelo White, and Smith say the following tips may help older adults lose weight safely and keep it off, whether they’re on GLP-1s or not: [10] [11] Although shedding excess fat may enhance older adults’ health and quality of life, maintaining muscle is equally important for mobility, vitality, and overall well-being. Consuming adequate protein is crucial for muscle building and repair. Experts recommend having a little bit of protein with every meal and snack rather than a large amount at once. “A piece of chicken or fish the size of your palm is great for a meal,” Oshita says. “A fourth cup of your favorite nuts or seeds mixed with dried or fresh fruit is a great snack option.” [12] [13] During strength training workouts, Holly Lookabaugh-Deur, DSc, a physical therapist and educator at APTA Michigan, a component of the American Physical Therapy Association, recommends aiming for about 8 to 12 repetitions of five to seven different exercises involving each major muscle group: the core, arms and upper body, and legs and lower body. “A good rule of thumb to know if you are exercising at the right intensity is that you should be sufficiently fatigued after 8 to 12 repetitions,” she says. You can tell your muscle is fatigued if it quivers or the force behind the movement becomes weaker, Lookabaugh-Deur notes. If you can continue doing the exercise with ease, gradually add more weight. Weight lifting is the most obvious form of resistance training, but exercise bands and body weight workouts are great, too, Angelo White says. Some examples of the latter include squats, lunges, yoga, barre, Pilates, stair climbing, and push-ups. Lookabaugh-Deur also recommends the following for older adults: Adam Gilden, MD, MSCE, is an associate director of the Obesity Medicine Fellowship at University of Colorado School of Medicine and associate director of the Colorado University Medicine Weight Management and Wellness Clinic in Aurora. Dr. Gilden works in a multidisciplinary academic center with other physicians, nurse practitioners, registered dietitians, and a psychologist, and collaborates closely with bariatric surgeons. Gilden is very involved in education in obesity medicine, lecturing in one of the obesity medicine board review courses and serving as the lead author on the Annals of Internal Medicine article ""In the Clinic"" on obesity. He lives in Denver, where he enjoys spending time with family, and playing tennis. weight loss weight loss weight loss weight loss weight loss weight loss weight loss weight loss weight loss weight loss","— when lifeline for many, for medications [1] and everyone.

"Ozempic study on weight loss drugs side effects, FDA red dye 3 ban, flu cases and norovirus vaccine | AMA Update Video | AMA",https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/ozempic-study-weight-loss-drugs-side-effects-fda-red-dye-3-ban-flu,"AMA Update covers a range of health care topics affecting the lives of physicians, residents, medical students and patients. From private practice and health system leaders to scientists and public health officials, hear from the experts in medicine on COVID-19, medical education, advocacy issues, burnout, vaccines and more. What does Ozempic do? What are the side effects of Ozempic? Is bird flu still around? Is there a vaccine for norovirus? Is red dye 3 banned in U.S.? AMA's Vice President of Science, Medicine and Public Health, Andrea Garcia, JD, MPH, discusses high rates of COVID, RSV and seasonal flu, as well as the recent CDC alert regarding hospital testing and treatments for bird flu. Also covering the FDA ban on red dye no. 3, plus new research on how GLP-1 drugs could lower the risk of 42 health conditions like Alzheimer's, dementia, substance abuse disorders and more. AMA Chief Experience Officer Todd Unger hosts. AMA membership offers unique access to savings and resources tailored to enrich the personal and professional lives of physicians, residents and medical students. Garcia: Cases of flu, COVID and RSV remain high across the U.S. And they're likely going to stay that way for several more weeks. The CDC also reports that this is causing a lot of people to seek health care at a high level. So many hospitals and physicians are likely really feeling this right now. Unger: Hello and welcome to the AMA Update video and podcast. Today we have our weekly look at the headlines with the AMA's Vice President of Science, Medicine and Public Health, Andrea Garcia. I'm Todd Unger, AMA's chief experience officer. Welcome back, Andrea. Garcia: Thanks, Todd. It's great to be here. Unger: Pretty chilly day here in Chicago. And lots to talk about, as usual. Andrea, last time we talked, we didn't get a chance to talk about bird flu. But there have been some developments, including a new CDC alert. Tell us more about that. Garcia: Well, last Thursday, the CDC issued a HAN, or a health alert, to clinicians and laboratories in response to those human infections we've been seeing with avian influenza A, H5N1. And the agency is urging health-care professionals to accelerate subtyping of all influenza A specimens from hospitalized patients. Particularly those who are in the ICU, the agency is recommending a subtyping diagnostic test, ideally within 24 hours of admission, as well as increasing efforts at clinical labs to identify nonseasonal influenza. The alert also emphasizes to clinicians starting antiviral treatments such as Tamiflu immediately, without waiting for those test results, and taking a thorough exposure history from a patient with suspected or confirmed influenza who is hospitalized. And as we talked about last week, this alert does come at a time when levels of seasonal flu activity are already very high. Unger: Andrea, what's the thinking behind this change? Garcia: Well, this approach can help prevent delays in identifying human infections with avian influenza A viruses. We know that those delays in diagnosing bird flu can complicate public-health investigations and delay treatment for exposed individuals and can also affect hospital-infection control. Those patients who are not tested right away might struggle to remember where they've been exposed or the people they've been in contact with since becoming sick. Plus, with those seasonal cases so high right now, it's really essential to distinguish between seasonal flu and bird flu as quickly as possible. Unger: Well, this theoretically seems like a pretty easy fix, testing people as they get, of course, admitted to the hospital. Is it that easy? Garcia: It may sound like it, but most influenza tests ordered in clinical settings don't distinguish between avian influenza A H5 and seasonal influenza A viruses. So, a positive result simply confirms an influenza A virus infection. If hospitals don't have the capability to do that subtyping on site, they may need to send those specimens to either commercial labs or to public health labs that do. And then it's also going to be important to notify the health department promptly if H5N1 virus infection is suspected, probable or confirmed in a hospitalized patient. A CDC spokesperson noted that by the time these test results often come back, the patient may already be discharged. Their household contacts may no longer be within the window for effective antiviral treatment, which we know works best when it's given early. Unger: So, lots of challenges there. Andrea, given the circumstances, what are the numbers looking like right now for both seasonal flu and for bird flu? Garcia: Yeah, looking at seasonal flu first, the CDC's estimating that there have been at least 12 million illnesses, 160,000 hospitalizations and 6,600 deaths from flu so far this season. As for bird flu, we recently learned about another human infection, a child in San Francisco who developed a fever and conjunctivitis but was not hospitalized, and thankfully, has since recovered. Including that case, 67 people have been infected by bird flu to date. And California has been hit the hardest, accounting for 38 of those cases based on the CDC data. Unger: Now, Andrea, I know a few months ago there had been some discussion about a vaccine. Any movement on that front? Garcia: Well, as we've discussed previously, there are several vaccines that target H5N1. And the federal government has been working to increase the number of doses in the national stockpile. Just last week, we did see the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announce that it will be awarding $590 million to Moderna. And that is to accelerate the development of influenza vaccine, including those that protect against bird flu. We do know that since 2023 Moderna has been working to create pandemic influenza vaccine, which would help protect against certain viruses, including H5N1 bird flu. This new funding builds on the $176 million that HHS awarded Moderna last July. On Friday, Moderna said that this additional funding is going to help pay for late-stage development, licensure of the vaccines and expanded clinical studies for additional subtypes of pandemic influenza to hopefully help prevent other potential public health emergencies. And as a reminder, last week we talked about how Moderna is currently enrolling participants in a stage III trial for a norovirus vaccine. There's definitely a lot going on in this space. Unger: There is a lot. And that's good news. Andrea, we'll look forward to seeing what comes out of that research, obviously. Let's turn our attention to the myriad other viruses that are out there right now. What's the background there? Garcia: An ABC News article published earlier this week gave a good overview of the situation, and according to the article and CDC data, cases of flu, COVID and RSV remain high across the U.S. And they're likely going to stay that way for several more weeks. The CDC also reports that this is causing a lot of people to seek health care at a high level. So many hospitals and physicians are really feeling this right now. As of January 11, emergency room visits and hospitalizations were highest for flu, followed by COVID and RSV, which are similar levels. Death rates, however, are at the highest for COVID at 1.4%, followed by flu at 1.2 and RSV point 1.1%. The CDC also said that while some indicators may be suggesting that illness activity has decreased or remain stable, this could definitely be due to reporting delays from the winter holiday and changes in whether people decided to seek health care, rather than an indication that respiratory virus activity has actually peaked. Unger: All right. Well, thank you for that update. And I know the advice continues to remain the same. If you feel sick, stay home and be sure to contact your physician if symptoms persist. Of course, it's also never too late to get vaccinated. Andrea, let's turn now to another topic that made headlines last week. The FDA has banned a controversial red dye. Tell us more about that and the evidence that prompted the decision. Garcia: So we're talking about a dye that is known as red dye number 3. This dye gives items that cherry-red hue. It can be found in many candies, drinks and snacks, such as bubble gum, fruit cocktail. According to articles in the Washington Post and the New York Times, as well as other media outlets, this dye is already prohibited in the EU and elsewhere. And in the U.S., the coloring was removed from cosmetics decades ago. So last Wednesday, we saw the FDA move to ban the dye after more than two years of pressure from advocates who argue that it's safer to use natural coloring that's derived from plants such as beets and red cabbage. This dye is not to be confused with red dye number 40, which is found in some popular breakfast cereals and has a different chemical composition than red number 3, which has been shown to cause cancer in rats when it's given at high doses. While the FDA did decide to remove the artificial dye, the agency maintains that there is no evidence that ingesting the coloring causes cancer in humans. The agency said it based its decision on the Delaney Clause of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which prohibits additives found to cause cancer in humans or animals at any dose. Unger: So, this big change, does that happen right away? Or what does the implementation look like? Garcia: Well, it doesn't happen immediately. The dye must be removed from food by mid-January of 2027 and from ingested drugs the following year. Some prominent manufacturers have already removed the dye from popular items, such as Peep candy, which we see a lot around Easter. That's because this dye is already banned in other places. So many food and beverage makers do already have recipes without it that they can now use for U.S. consumers. Advocates are also now urging the agency to take a look at its regulation of red dye number 40, as well as yellow dyes number 5 and 6, blue dyes numbers 1 and 2, and green dye number 3. So, my guess is that we likely haven't heard the last on this. Unger: I'm sure a lot of people are eagerly awaiting the developments there. Before we end this week, Andrea, one more topic to cover, and that's Ozempic, which is once again in the news. What do we need to know about that? Garcia: Well, although Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs always seem to be in the news this week, the headlines were because of a large study on GLP-1 drugs that was conducted, that found that these drugs could potentially lower the risk of 42 health conditions. There was an article in Fortune that provided a good overview. This observational study was led by researchers at the Veterans Affairs Saint Louis Health Care System. It found that the use of GLP-1 was associated with reduced risk of a number of surprising health problems, including substance-use disorders, suicidal ideation, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Risk reduction was also found for neurocognitive disorders like Alzheimer's and dementia, along with infections, liver cancer, and even life-threatening clotting disorders, like blood clots in the lungs. And then confirming what we already knew. These drugs showed benefits like a reduction in the risk of stroke, heart attacks, major cardiac events and kidney disease. Unger: Wow. That is just a huge number of possible benefits. Do we have any sense of how this works or why? Garcia: Well, I think that's really the question. And there are definitely some theories out there. But the answers are definitely subject to further research. And how this study's results will be interpreted or acted upon also remains to be seen. I also want to note that the study did find that people who took these medications also had a higher risk for some health outcomes. So there was an increased risk of nausea and vomiting, GERD, sleep disturbances, bone pain and abdominal pain. So, patients should be having a conversation with their physicians for an individualized risk-benefit analysis before they're starting these medications. And we know that GLP-1s could certainly find multiple uses over time. And this study helps suggest possible areas for future research. Unger: Well, very interesting possibilities there. And we will certainly be diving into those more in the future episodes. Well, that wraps up today's episode. As always, Andrea, thanks so much for being here and keeping us informed.

Todcoversy we hcoversve our weekly look coverst the hecoversdlines with the AMA's Vice President advocacy Science, Medicine coversnd Public Hecoverslth, Andrecovers Gcoversrcicovers. I'm Todd Unger, AMA's chief experience advocacyficer. Welcome bcoversck, Andrecovers. Gcoversrcicovers: Thcoversnks, Todd. It's grecoverst to be here. Unger: Pretty chilly dcoversy here in Chiccoversgo. And lots to tcoverslk coversbout, coverss usucoversl. Andrecovers, lcoversst time we tcoverslked, we didn't get covers chcoversnce to tcoverslk coversbout bird flu. But there hcoversve been some developments, including covers new CDC coverslert. Tell us more coversbout thcoverst. Gcoversrcicovers: Well, lcoversst Thursdcoversy, the CDC issued covers HAN, or covers Updcoverste coverslert, to clinicicoversns coversnd lcoversborcoverstories in response to those humcoversn infections we've been seeing with coversvicoversn influenzcovers A, H5N1. And the coversgency is urging Updcoverste-ccoversre pradvocacyessioncoversls to coversccelercoverste subtyping advocacy coversll influenzcovers A specimens from hospitcoverslized pcoverstients. Pcoversrticulcoversrly those who coversre in the ICU, the coversgency is recommending covers subtyping dicoversgnostic test, idecoverslly within 24 hours advocacy coversdmission, coverss well coverss increcoverssing efforts coverst cliniccoversl lcoversbs to identify nonsecoverssoncoversl influenzcovers. The coverslert coverslso emphcoverssizes to clinicicoversns stcoversrting coversntivircoversl trecoverstments such coverss Tcoversmiflu immedicoverstely, without wcoversiting for those test results, coversnd tcoversking covers thorough exposure history from covers pcoverstient with suspected or confirmed influenzcovers who is hospitcoverslized. And coverss we tcoverslked coversbout lcoversst week, this coverslert does come coverst covers time when levels advocacy secoverssoncoversl flu coversctivity coversre coverslrecoversdy very high. Unger: Andrecovers, whcoverst's the thinking behind this chcoversnge? Gcoversrcicovers: Well, this coverspprocoversch ccoversn help prevent delcoversys in identifying humcoversn infections with coversvicoversn influenzcovers A viruses. We know thcoverst those delcoversys in dicoversgnosing bird flu ccoversn compliccoverste public-Updcoverste investigcoverstions coversnd delcoversy trecoverstment for exposed individucoversls coversnd ccoversn coverslso coversffect hospitcoversl-infection control. Those pcoverstients who coversre not tested right coverswcoversy might struggle to remember where they've been exposed or the people they've been in contcoversct with since becoming sick. Plus, with those secoverssoncoversl ccoversses so high right now, it's recoverslly essenticoversl to distinguish between secoverssoncoversl flu coversnd bird flu coverss quickly coverss possible. Unger: Well, this theoreticcoverslly seems like covers pretty ecoverssy fix, testing people coverss they get, advocacy course, coversdmitted to the hospitcoversl. Is it thcoverst ecoverssy? Gcoversrcicovers: It mcoversy sound like it, but most influenzcovers tests ordered in cliniccoversl settings don't distinguish between coversvicoversn influenzcovers A H5 coversnd secoverssoncoversl influenzcovers A viruses. So, covers positive result simply confirms coversn influenzcovers A virus infection. If hospitcoversls don't hcoversve the ccoverspcoversbility to do thcoverst subtyping on site, they mcoversy need to send those specimens to either commercicoversl lcoversbs or to public Updcoverste lcoversbs thcoverst do. And then it's coverslso going to be importcoversnt to notify the Updcoverste depcoversrtment promptly if H5N1 virus infection is suspected, probcoversble or confirmed in covers hospitcoverslized pcoverstient. A CDC spokesperson noted thcoverst by the time these test results advocacyten come bcoversck, the pcoverstient mcoversy coverslrecoversdy be dischcoversrged. Their household contcoverscts mcoversy no longer be within the window for effective coversntivircoversl trecoverstment, which we know works best when it's given ecoversrly. Unger: So, lots advocacy chcoversllenges there. Andrecovers, given the circumstcoversnces, whcoverst coversre the numbers looking like right now for both secoverssoncoversl flu coversnd for bird flu? Gcoversrcicovers: Yecoversh, looking coverst secoverssoncoversl flu first, the CDC's estimcoversting thcoverst there hcoversve been coverst lecoversst 12 million illnesses, 160,000 hospitcoverslizcoverstions coversnd 6,600 decoversths from flu so fcoversr this secoversson. As for bird flu, we recently lecoversrned coversbout coversnother humcoversn infection, covers child in Scoversn Frcoversncisco who developed covers fever coversnd conjunctivitis but wcoverss not hospitcoverslized, coversnd thcoversnkfully, hcoverss since recovered. Including thcoverst ccoversse, 67 people hcoversve been infected by bird flu to dcoverste. And Ccoverslifornicovers hcoverss been hit the hcoversrdest, coversccounting for 38 advocacy those ccoversses bcoverssed on the CDC dcoverstcovers. Unger: Now, Andrecovers, I know covers few months coversgo there hcoversd been some discussion coversbout covers vcoversccine. Any movement on thcoverst front? Gcoversrcicovers: Well, coverss we've discussed previously, there coversre severcoversl vcoversccines thcoverst tcoversrget H5N1. And the federcoversl government hcoverss been working to increcoversse the number advocacy doses in the ncoverstioncoversl stockpile. Just lcoversst week, we did see the U.S. Depcoversrtment advocacy Hecoverslth coversnd Humcoversn Services coversnnounce thcoverst it will be coverswcoversrding $590 million to Moderncovers. And thcoverst is to coversccelercoverste the development advocacy influenzcovers vcoversccine, including those thcoverst protect coversgcoversinst bird flu. We do know thcoverst since 2023 Moderncovers hcoverss been working to crecoverste pcoversndemic influenzcovers vcoversccine, which would help protect coversgcoversinst certcoversin viruses, including H5N1 bird flu. This new funding builds on the $176 million thcoverst HHS coverswcoversrded Moderncovers lcoversst July. On Fridcoversy, Moderncovers scoversid thcoverst this coversdditioncoversl funding is going to help pcoversy for lcoverste-stcoversge development, licensure advocacy the vcoversccines coversnd expcoversnded cliniccoversl studies for coversdditioncoversl subtypes advocacy pcoversndemic influenzcovers to hopefully help prevent other potenticoversl public Updcoverste emergencies. And coverss covers reminder, lcoversst week we tcoverslked coversbout how Moderncovers is currently enrolling pcoversrticipcoversnts in covers stcoversge III tricoversl for covers norovirus vcoversccine. There's definitely covers lot going on in this spcoversce. Unger: There is covers lot. And thcoverst's good news. Andrecovers, we'll look forwcoversrd to seeing whcoverst comes out advocacy thcoverst resecoversrch, obviously. Let's turn our coversttention to the myricoversd other viruses thcoverst coversre out there right now. Whcoverst's the bcoversckground there? Gcoversrcicovers: An ABC News coversrticle published ecoversrlier this week gcoversve covers good overview advocacy the situcoverstion, coversnd coversccording to the coversrticle coversnd CDC dcoverstcovers, ccoversses advocacy flu, COVID coversnd RSV remcoversin high coverscross the U.S. And they're likely going to stcoversy thcoverst wcoversy for severcoversl more weeks. The CDC coverslso reports thcoverst this is ccoversusing covers lot advocacy people to seek Updcoverste ccoversre coverst covers high level. So mcoversny hospitcoversls coversnd physicicoversns coversre recoverslly feeling this right now. As advocacy Jcoversnucoversry 11, emergency room visits coversnd hospitcoverslizcoverstions were highest for flu, followed by COVID coversnd RSV, which coversre similcoversr levels. Decoversth rcoverstes, however, coversre coverst the highest for COVID coverst 1.4%, followed by flu coverst 1.2 coversnd RSV point 1.1%. The CDC coverslso scoversid thcoverst while some indiccoverstors mcoversy be suggesting thcoverst illness coversctivity hcoverss decrecoverssed or remcoversin stcoversble, this could definitely be due to reporting delcoversys from the winter holidcoversy coversnd chcoversnges in whether people decided to seek Updcoverste ccoversre, rcoversther thcoversn coversn indiccoverstion thcoverst respircoverstory virus coversctivity hcoverss coversctucoverslly pecoversked. Unger: All right. Well, thcoversnk you for thcoverst updcoverste. And I know the coversdvice continues to remcoversin the scoversme. If you feel sick, stcoversy home coversnd be sure to contcoversct your physicicoversn if symptoms persist. Of course, it's coverslso never too lcoverste to get vcoversccincoversted. Andrecovers, let's turn now to coversnother topic thcoverst mcoversde hecoversdlines lcoversst week. The FDA hcoverss bcoversnned covers controversicoversl red dye. Tell us more coversbout thcoverst coversnd the evidence thcoverst prompted the decision. Gcoversrcicovers: So we're tcoverslking coversbout covers dye thcoverst is known coverss red dye number 3. This dye gives items thcoverst cherry-red hue. It ccoversn be found in mcoversny ccoversndies, drinks coversnd sncoverscks, such coverss bubble gum, fruit cocktcoversil. According to coversrticles in the Wcoversshington Post coversnd the New York Times, coverss well coverss other medicovers outlets, this dye is coverslrecoversdy prohibited in the EU coversnd elsewhere. And in the U.S., the coloring wcoverss removed from cosmetics deccoversdes coversgo. So lcoversst Wednesdcoversy, we scoversw the FDA move to bcoversn the dye coversfter more thcoversn two yecoversrs advocacy pressure from coversdvoccoverstes who coversrgue thcoverst it's scoversfer to use ncoversturcoversl coloring thcoverst's derived from plcoversnts such coverss beets coversnd red ccoversbbcoversge. This dye is not to be confused with red dye number 40, which is found in some populcoversr brecoverskfcoversst cerecoversls coversnd hcoverss covers different chemiccoversl composition thcoversn red number 3, which hcoverss been shown to ccoversuse ccoversncer in rcoversts when it's given coverst high doses. While the FDA did decide to remove the coversrtificicoversl dye, the coversgency mcoversintcoversins thcoverst there is no evidence thcoverst ingesting the coloring ccoversuses ccoversncer in humcoversns. The coversgency scoversid it bcoverssed its decision on the Delcoversney Clcoversuse advocacy the Federcoversl Food, Drug, coversnd Cosmetic Act, which prohibits coversdditives found to ccoversuse ccoversncer in humcoversns or coversnimcoversls coverst coversny dose. Unger: So, this big chcoversnge, does thcoverst hcoversppen right coverswcoversy? Or whcoverst does the implementcoverstion look like? Gcoversrcicovers: Well, it doesn't hcoversppen immedicoverstely. The dye must be removed from food by mid-Jcoversnucoversry advocacy 2027 coversnd from ingested drugs the following yecoversr. Some prominent mcoversnufcoverscturers hcoversve coverslrecoversdy removed the dye from populcoversr items, such coverss Peep ccoversndy, which we see covers lot coversround Ecoversster. Thcoverst's beccoversuse this dye is coverslrecoversdy bcoversnned in other plcoversces. So mcoversny food coversnd bevercoversge mcoverskers do coverslrecoversdy hcoversve recipes without it thcoverst they ccoversn now use for U.S. consumers. Advoccoverstes coversre coverslso now urging the coversgency to tcoverske covers look coverst its regulcoverstion advocacy red dye number 40, coverss well coverss yellow dyes number 5 coversnd 6, blue dyes numbers 1 coversnd 2, coversnd green dye number 3. So, my guess is thcoverst we likely hcoversven't hecoversrd the lcoversst on this. Unger: I'm sure covers lot advocacy people coversre ecoversgerly coverswcoversiting the developments there. Before we end this week, Andrecovers, one more topic to cover, coversnd thcoverst's Ozempic, which is once coversgcoversin in the news. Whcoverst do we need to know coversbout thcoverst? Gcoversrcicovers: Well, coverslthough Ozempic coversnd other GLP-1 drugs coverslwcoversys seem to be in the news this week, the hecoversdlines were beccoversuse advocacy covers lcoversrge study on GLP-1 drugs thcoverst wcoverss conducted, thcoverst found thcoverst these drugs could potenticoverslly lower the risk advocacy 42 Updcoverste conditions. There wcoverss coversn coversrticle in Fortune thcoverst provided covers good overview. This observcoverstioncoversl study wcoverss led by resecoversrchers coverst the Vetercoversns Affcoversirs Scoversint Louis Hecoverslth Ccoversre System. It found thcoverst the use advocacy GLP-1 wcoverss coversssocicoversted with reduced risk advocacy covers number advocacy surprising Updcoverste problems, including substcoversnce-use disorders, suicidcoversl idecoverstion, schizophrenicovers coversnd other psychotic disorders. Risk reduction wcoverss coverslso found for neurocognitive disorders like Alzheimer's coversnd dementicovers, coverslong with infections, liver ccoversncer, coversnd even life-threcoverstening clotting disorders, like blood clots in the lungs. And then confirming whcoverst we coverslrecoversdy knew. These drugs showed benefits like covers reduction in the risk advocacy stroke, hecoversrt coversttcoverscks, mcoversjor ccoversrdicoversc events coversnd kidney disecoversse. Unger: Wow. Thcoverst is just covers huge number advocacy possible benefits. Do we hcoversve coversny sense advocacy how this works or why? Gcoversrcicovers: Well, I think thcoverst's recoverslly the question. And there coversre definitely some theories out there. But the coversnswers coversre definitely subject to further resecoversrch. And how this study's results will be interpreted or coverscted upon coverslso remcoversins to be seen. I coverslso wcoversnt to note thcoverst the study did find thcoverst people who took these mediccoverstions coverslso hcoversd covers higher risk for some Updcoverste outcomes. So there wcoverss coversn increcoverssed risk advocacy ncoversusecovers coversnd vomiting, GERD, sleep disturbcoversnces, bone pcoversin coversnd coversbdomincoversl pcoversin. So, pcoverstients should be hcoversving covers converscoverstion with their physicicoversns for coversn individucoverslized risk-benefit coversncoverslysis before they're stcoversrting these mediccoverstions. And we know thcoverst GLP-1s could certcoversinly find multiple uses over time. And this study helps suggest possible coversrecoverss for future resecoversrch. Unger: Well, very interesting possibilities there. And we will certcoversinly be diving into those more in the future episodes. Well, thcoverst wrcoversps up todcoversy's episode.

Patients Are Suing Over Alleged Side Effects of Weight-Loss Drugs | TIME,https://time.com/7130456/ozempic-side-effects-wegovy-mounjaro-gastroparesis-weight-loss/,"In 2021, Jacqueline Barber agreed to try Ozempic because her doctor swore it would “work wonders” for her diabetes. A few months later, the vomiting started. Barber, who is 49 and lives in Kentucky, threw up constantly, so much that she started sleeping on the couch with a garbage can beside her every night. But the drug was keeping her blood sugar under control and her endocrinologist didn’t think it could be the cause of such persistent vomiting, so she stayed on it—even as she began “wasting away,” her muscles deteriorating so much that she needed a walker and her front teeth crumbling from exposure to stomach acid. Unable to keep food down, Barber’s weight dropped by more than 100 pounds over roughly one year on Ozempic, until her doctors finally agreed she should stop taking the medication. “It was the worst thing I’ve ever experienced in my life,” Barber says. “My family thought I was getting ready to die.” Around the same time she stopped taking Ozempic, Barber was diagnosed with gastroparesis: a condition also known as stomach paralysis that causes the stomach muscles to stop moving food through the digestive tract effectively, potentially leading to vomiting and a number of other GI symptoms. Now, more than a year after her diagnosis, Barber still can’t eat normally and gets some nourishment through a feeding tube. She remains weak, barely able to walk around the corner to her sister’s house. Doctors have told her it’s “impossible” for Ozempic to take such a long-lasting toll, and her medical records list her gastroparesis as “idiopathic”—that is, without a known cause. But Barber feels certain the medication is at the root of her problems. If she had known what was to come, Barber says, she would never have taken Ozempic. “No one would.” Read More: No One Knows How to Talk About Weight Loss Anymore Millions of people in the U.S.—about 6% of the adult population, according to health-research organization KFF—take Ozempic or a drug like it, including Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound. These drugs are collectively known as GLP-1 agonists because they mimic the body’s natural hormone GLP-1, which regulates appetite and digestion. The medications control blood sugar and help people eat less, which makes them highly effective treatments for both diabetes (for which Ozempic and Mounjaro are approved) and obesity (the target of Wegovy and Zepbound). They can also slash risks of heart attack, stroke, and chronic disease, studies suggest. And research continues to uncover new and surprising potential uses for GLP-1s, from addiction treatments to fertility boosters. “Everybody wants to be on these drugs,” which are often seen as “magic,” says Clipper Young, a clinical pharmacist at Touro University California. But there’s a catch. While most patients take GLP-1 drugs with few or no serious side effects, it's common to experience at least mild gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, constipation, and diarrhea. In some studies, more than half of patients reported nausea and roughly a third reported vomiting. And as the drugs get more popular, the list of potential side effects is growing longer. Researchers have recently found links between GLP-1 drugs and gastroparesis, intestinal blockage, inflammation of the pancreas, blood clots, and an eye disease that can lead to blindness. Research has also long raised concerns about a potential increased risk of thyroid tumors among susceptible patients. Dr. Sandeep Palakodeti, a personalized health care entrepreneur who has written about the need for unbiased research and education about GLP-1 drugs, says these emerging reports are ""definitely a signal that we need to investigate a little bit more."" It’s not unusual, he says, for new safety concerns to bubble up after a drug is already on the market. If a side effect is rare, it may not arise even in a large, well-designed clinical trial. But once a medication is prescribed to millions of people from all walks of life—not just those who fit the specific patient profile required to participate in a study—it’s likely that some of them will have the misfortune of experiencing a rare complication. Post-approval safety issues arose for a third of novel drugs approved from 2001 through 2010, leading a small number to be pulled from the market and many more to be labeled with additional safety warnings, research shows. Only time will tell if GLP-1 drugs are headed for those fates, Palakodeti says. Novo Nordisk, the drug company that makes Ozempic and Wegovy, and Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Mounjaro and Zepbound, do not deny that their drugs cause side effects, most often involving GI discomfort. But, the companies say, these side effects are usually mild to moderate, improve over time, and altogether stop if patients decide to go off their medications—contrary to what patients like Barber argue has happened to them. Read More: 12 Weird Symptoms Endocrinologists Say You Should Never Ignore More research is needed to determine whether GLP-1 drugs are actually to blame for complications that some patients have experienced. When millions of people use a medication, some of them are bound to develop health issues while taking it—but that doesn’t necessarily mean their prescription caused the problem. Still, when someone develops health problems after taking a new drug, their natural reaction is often to blame the medication—and to stop using it. Clinical trial data from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk suggest fewer than 10% of GLP-1 study participants dropped out due to side effects. But clinical trials are artificial environments: In the real world, 37% of people using a GLP-1 drug for either diabetes or weight loss had quit a year after starting, according to 2024 research published in JAMA Network Open. People were more likely to have quit if they had developed gastrointestinal side effects, the study found—but insurance hassles and expenses may also be factors, since the drugs can cost more than $1,000 per month out-of-pocket. Some patients are going further than quitting. Thousands of people who have developed health problems including intestinal blockages, gallbladder damage, and especially gastroparesis after taking GLP-1s have filed, or are expected to file, lawsuits against Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, arguing they were not adequately informed about the risks of using these medications, according to court documents associated with those claims. In a statement to TIME, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk said the company is ""aware of the health challenges that some of these patients have experienced and are sympathetic to their health journey,” but maintained that side-effect lawsuits against the company are “without merit.” A spokesperson for Eli Lilly also said in a statement to TIME that the lawsuits do not have merit and that the company will “vigorously defend against these claims.” And, in a joint position statement filed in response to those patient lawsuits, representatives for the companies emphasized that their drugs have been assessed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and that GLP-1s have been used and studied for “many years.” The drugs’ proven risks are listed on product labels, they wrote. (Neither company made executives available for on-the-record interviews.) A Pennsylvania judge is overseeing these lawsuits, none of which have gone to trial yet. But the judge has already signaled some willingness to side with the drug companies, in August agreeing to consider their request for stricter standards around proof of diagnosis for patients who claim to have gastroparesis. (Gastroparesis is often misdiagnosed when judged by its symptoms alone, studies show.) Andrew Van Arsdale, founding attorney at AVA Law Group, a personal-injury firm working with many of those current or potential plaintiffs, says there may be additional cases focused on other alleged side effects, like blindness and blood clots, in the future. “I just want people to have the education I didn’t,” says Barber, one of Van Arsdale’s clients who, like most plaintiffs in the group, is in the process of suing over gastroparesis. Some unpleasantness is an expected and accepted part of medical care, as almost every drug comes with side effects. But as patients like Dana Filmore have learned, the side effects of GLP-1s can become intolerable. Filmore, who is 55 and lives in Ohio, hates needles, so she wasn’t thrilled by the idea of injecting herself with Ozempic once a week, possibly for the rest of her life. But she wanted to get her diabetes under control, so started taking it in 2021. Filmore felt fine at first. But as her doctors progressively raised her dose, things started to go sideways. Eventually, she developed such bad digestive complications—sometimes constipation, sometimes diarrhea and an urgent need to empty her bowels—that she couldn’t go anywhere without first making sure she’d have easy access to a bathroom. Once, she had an accident while driving to work. “I’m 55, and I feel like I need to walk around with Depends on,” she says. “It’s embarrassing.” Read More: Why Gut Health Issues Are More Common in Women Filmore’s physicians encouraged her to stay on Ozempic for the sake of her diabetes, and she did for a while. But last summer, she decided she’d had enough. Even a year after she stopped, her stomach hasn’t gone back to normal. She says her primary care physician agrees that the drug is probably behind her digestive problems. Filmore has not yet filed a lawsuit against Novo Nordisk, but she is also working with Van Arsdale’s firm on potential litigation related to her complications.“I just want them to admit that they’re altering people’s lives,” she says. In legal proceedings, lawyers for the companies have argued that their drugs temporarily and purposely slow digestion but do not cause chronic issues such as gastroparesis, noting that side effects should disappear within about a month of going off the medications. “You stop the medication, the GI side effects go away,” Dr. Lucas Przymusinski, a lawyer and internal-medicine physician representing Novo Nordisk, said during a September presentation of scientific evidence in a Philadelphia court. “That’s how it works.” Dr. Laura Davisson, director of the Medical Weight Management program at West Virginia University who is not involved in either Barber or Filmore’s care, agrees. She says she’s never seen such a long-lasting case of side effects in her practice. In fact, she often emphasizes to her patients that side effects aren’t permanent. “I always say, ‘It doesn’t really make sense to not get the benefit of a medication because you’re worried about a side effect,’” she says. “‘You don’t even know if you’ll get that side effect, and if that side effect does occur, it’s reversible.’” Even serious risks aren’t necessarily a reason for regulators not to approve a drug, as long as the medication provides more benefit than risk overall. Drug makers are, however, required to disclose potential dangers—and disclosure is at the heart of patient lawsuits, with users claiming they were not adequately warned about gastroparesis or other complications. Read More: 15 Things to Say When Someone Comments on Your Weight Mahyar Etminan, a drug safety epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia whose research has shown a connection between GLP-1 medications and gastroparesis, says it’s time for additional warnings about stomach paralysis, given that his study and others suggest increased risk. Regulators have recommended warning labels “with much less data, to be honest with you,” he says. “I’m not sure why there isn’t a warning [for gastroparesis] yet.” (During the September presentation of scientific evidence, representatives for Novo Nordisk noted that Etminan and his co-authors are not gastroenterologists and said their study was not enough to establish cause and effect.) Eli Lilly’s warning label for Mounjaro says it can cause “severe” gastrointestinal problems and is not recommended for patients with preexisting gastroparesis, but the label doesn’t explicitly list gastroparesis as a possible side effect. The labels for Ozempic and Wegovy don’t specifically mention gastroparesis either, though they do say that vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and other GI symptoms linked to the condition are common. Przymusinski told the judge overseeing the cases that the FDA has thoroughly reviewed safety and labeling data for GLP-1s and “never has mandated a warning for gastroparesis.” The agency has, however, requested more information about reported side effects and is ""evaluating the need for regulatory action."" In 2023, the agency added a warning about intestinal blockages to Ozempic’s label. One complicating factor: gastroparesis can stem from diabetes, the condition that causes many people to start using GLP-1 drugs in the first place. If a patient with mild diabetic gastroparesis starts taking a drug that purposely slows digestion, it’s not a stretch to see how the medication could make their preexisting problem worse, says Young, the clinical pharmacist. But are GLP-1s really at fault for doing exactly what they’re marketed to do—especially if, as the company’s lawyers argue, the drugs aren’t capable of causing permanent damage? Read More: What to Know About Diabetes and the Risk of Silent Heart Attacks At this point, Young says, there’s enough data to warrant better screening of patients who may be at risk. But is it fair to say the medications are causing these problems? “We just don’t have long-term data at this point,” he says. Davisson, the West Virginia obesity-medicine specialist, says most people can tolerate a GLP-1 just fine, as long as they’re counseled on how to manage side effects. The problem, she says, is that many providers can’t perfectly calibrate dosages, diets, and lifestyles to keep people feeling well. In an overburdened system, many providers simply don’t have time to have in-depth, ongoing conversations about side effects with their patients. New scientific research on these medications is also published constantly, and it’s hard for busy clinicians to keep up with it, says Palakodeti, the personalized-medicine physician. And much of that research is funded by the drug makers themselves (an issue not at all unique to GLP-1s). Studies have found that company-funded research tends to yield more positive results than independently financed studies. Pharmaceutical companies like Novo Nordisk have also spent millions of dollars promoting their drugs to physicians. Consciously or not, Palakodeti says, those influence campaigns can shape the way doctors practice medicine and communicate risks to patients. “When you’re sending a drug rep to the office with lunch for your entire staff, is that drug rep focusing on the positives and the negatives in the same light?” he asks. “Probably not.” “Novo Nordisk believes that responsible engagement between pharmaceutical companies and the medical community is good for patients and advances care and science,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “We never influence prescribing decisions, and we abide by all applicable laws and regulations, and our [recent] spend in this area has significantly decreased.” Despite the millions of prescriptions and the hundreds of studies that have analyzed GLP-1 drugs, questions remain about how they affect long-term health. More research is needed to know if these drugs are actually causing some of the complications patients are now reporting—and suing over. Filmore, the Ohio woman who quit using Ozempic because of her GI side effects, says all she wants is clarity, something no one seems able to give her. “Is this something I need to worry about for the rest of my life? Is it going to stop at some point? Is it going to get worse?” she wonders. “I would just like to know what I’m dealing with.”","her her few Bherrber, her her her her her her her her her her few her hernd her her thhert she threw up constherntly, sleeplherter, the Bherrber, herg on her couch wherh her gherrbherge chern beside her her diherbetes.

"Serious Ozempic Side Effects, Confirmed: Here’s What to Know",https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/serious-ozempic-side-effects-confirmed-150000655.html?utm_source=flipboard&utm_content=user%2FAOLcom,"""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."" Most people know that GLP-1 receptor agonist medications like Ozempic and Wegovy can cause relatively minor side effects like nausea and diarrhea. But new research confirms that more serious complications—like pancreatitis and kidney damage—are real. It's important to point out that most people who use GLP-1 receptor agonist medications do not experience these side effects. But, of course, you should be aware of all potential risks before using a medication. Here’s what the study suggests, plus what a weight loss physician wants you to know. Meet the expert: Mir Ali, MD, is the medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. The study, which was published in Nature Medicine on January 20, analyzed data from more than 2 million people with diabetes who took GLP-1 receptor agonist medications like Ozempic and Wegovy. The researchers found that these medications helped lower the risk of developing 42 different health conditions or outcomes, including dementia, cardiac arrest, and certain kinds of cancer. But they also discovered that people who took these medications had a higher risk of developing 19 different negative health outcomes. Those included nausea and vomiting, kidney stones, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), sleep issues, stomach cramps, pancreatitis, and gastroparesis (i.e. stomach paralysis). These findings are “consistent with other studies previously done,” says Mir Ali, MD, the medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. The risk of developing both of these conditions while taking a GLP-1 receptor agonist medication is low. But research has generally shown that the risk of developing pancreatitis while taking this medication is less than one percent. Reports of kidney damage have largely been limited to case reports, suggesting they’re extremely rare. Of course, it’s possible to have side effects on Ozempic without becoming seriously ill. According to the Ozempic website, more common side effects include: Nausea Diarrhea Constipation Stomach pain Vomiting Everyone reacts to these medications differently, Ali says. However, he says you can often lower your risk of side effects by staying well hydrated, eating smaller meals, and limiting processed foods, high-fat foods, and refined carbohydrates. Another thing to keep in mind: Side effects, if you do experience them, tend to ease in a few weeks when your body gets used to the medication, per Ali. “I do believe the benefits outweigh the risks; although gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, diarrhea or constipation are common, they are manageable, for the most part,” Ali says. “More serious side effects like pancreatitis and kidney complications are very rare.” You Might Also Like Can Apple Cider Vinegar Lead to Weight Loss?

"Does weight loss, diabetes drug semaglutide cut alcohol cravings?",https://today.usc.edu/popular-weight-loss-diabetes-drug-shows-promise-in-reducing-cravings-for-alcohol/,"An estimated 178,000 U.S. deaths per year can be attributed to alcohol, which is linked to liver disease, cardiovascular disease and is a known cause of cancer. (Photo/iStock) USC-led trial confirms side effect: Semaglutide, better known as Ozempic and Wegovy, could also help people cut down on their alcohol intake. The blockbuster drug semaglutide, better known as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for obesity, could also help people cut down on their alcohol intake, according to new research led by a USC investigator. The findings, published in JAMA Psychiatry, showed that weekly injections of semaglutide — compared with placebo injections — reduced alcohol craving, drinking quantity and the frequency of heavy drinking days in adults with symptoms of alcohol use disorder. The discovery could help address an important treatment gap: An estimated 178,000 U.S. deaths per year can be attributed to alcohol, which is linked to liver disease, cardiovascular disease and is a known cause of cancer, as noted recently by the U.S. surgeon general. Nearly a third of American adults have met criteria for problem drinking at some point in their lives, yet very few seek or receive treatment. The study affirms a common observation by many patients and doctors since Ozempic and drugs like it exploded in popularity: People begin weekly injections of semaglutide for obesity or diabetes — and suddenly lose their desire for alcohol. This is the first randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of semaglutide designed to study the phenomenon, said Christian Hendershot, first author of the study and director of clinical research at USC’s Institute for Addiction Science. The drugs currently approved to treat alcohol use disorder aren’t widely used. The popularity of semaglutide and other GLP-1 receptor agonists increases the chances of broad adoption of these treatments for alcohol use disorder, if approved for this indication, said Hendershot, a professor of population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. These results justify larger studies of GLP-1 receptor agonists for alcohol use disorder, Hendershot added. For the trial, researchers recruited 48 adults with alcohol use disorder who weren’t actively seeking treatment. Alcohol use disorder is defined by a range of possible symptoms, including the inability to stop or control one’s drinking despite negative consequences. Participants had a past-month drinking history of more than seven (for women) or more than 14 (for men) standard drinks in a week as well as two or more heavy drinking episodes (four or more drinks for women and five or more for men). One week prior to the first injection, researchers invited participants to drink their preferred alcoholic beverage over a two-hour period in a comfortable, lab setting, with instructions to delay drinking if they wished. Researchers documented the amount of alcohol consumed. Participants were then randomly assigned to receive weekly, low-dose injections of Ozempic or a placebo for nine weeks, during which time their weekly drinking patterns were also measured. Afterward, participants and researchers returned to the drinking lab to repeat the process and see what changed. Results, measured by grams of alcohol consumed and breath alcohol concentration, indicated that semaglutide injections reduced weekly alcohol craving, reduced average drinks on drinking days and led to greater reductions in heavy drinking days, relative to the placebo. A key finding was that the magnitude of semaglutide’s effects on several drinking outcomes appeared greater than is often seen with existing medications to reduce alcohol cravings, even though semaglutide was only administered at the lowest clinical doses. Medication effects also appeared stronger with increasing doses. By the second month of treatment, those in the semaglutide group had reduced the quantify of alcohol consumed on drinking days by an average of nearly 30%, compared to an average reduction of about 2% in the placebo group. Also, nearly 40% of people in the semaglutide group reported no heavy drinking days in the second month of treatment, compared to 20% in the placebo group. Among a small subgroup of participants who smoked cigarettes at baseline, those treated with semaglutide had significantly greater reductions in average cigarettes per day compared to those in the placebo group, suggesting that semaglutide might reduce both alcohol and nicotine use. “These data suggest the potential of semaglutide and similar drugs to fill an unmet need for the treatment of alcohol use disorder,” said senior author Klara Klein of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. “Larger and longer studies in broader populations are needed to fully understand the safety and efficacy in people with alcohol use disorder, but these initial findings are promising.” About this study: In addition to Hendershot and Klein, other authors of the study are Michael Bremmer, Michael Paladino, Georgios Kostantinis, Thomas Gilmore, Neil Sullivan, Amanda Tow and Robyn Jordan, all of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Sarah S.

"Study: Link Between Ozempic, Weight Loss Drugs and Blindness",https://www.prevention.com/health/a63774334/ozempic-blindness-weight-loss-drugs/,"A new study delves into sudden vision changes and these popular medications. For all the buzz surrounding weight loss medications like semaglutide and tirzepatide, these drugs aren’t perfect. They come with a risk of side effects like nausea and diarrhea, along with uncommon side effects like gastroparesis (stomach paralysis) and decreased kidney function. However, new research suggests a link between weight loss drugs and blindness (and other eye issues), leading some to refer to the issue as “Ozempic blindness.” A small study published in JAMA Ophthalmology analyzed data from nine patients who developed severe vision issues, including sudden blindness, while taking semaglutide (Wegovy, Ozempic) or tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound). Of those participants, seven developed a condition called non-arteritic ischemic anterior optic neuropathy (NAOIN, which is sudden vision loss due to lack of blood flow to the optic nerve, and is usually permanent), one developed bilateral papillitis (swelling of the optic nerve that leads to vision impairment and even loss which may be permanent) and another paracentral acute middle maculopathy (an issue with the retina that causes vision loss). Meet the experts: Mir Ali, M.D., a bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA; Christoph Buettner, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the division of endocrinology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School; Howard Krauss, M.D., a surgical neuro-ophthalmologist and director of Pacific Neuroscience Institute’s Eye, Ear & Skull Base Center at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. Some, according to the study, also experienced vision loss in one eye, swelling of both optic discs, and gradual vision loss. Despite the scary findings, the researchers stressed that it’s hard to conclude that medications like Ozempic and Zepbound actually caused vision issues. Still, this is a lot to absorb, especially if you or a loved one is considering using one of these medications. Here’s what doctors want you to know about taking a weight loss medication and vision health. First, let’s cover a few basics about these medications. Semaglutide is in a class of medications called GLP-1 receptor agonists. These medications mimic a protein in your body called glucagon-like peptide 1 (or GLP-1), explains Mir Ali, M.D., a bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. Tirzepatide is in a class of medications called glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors. Both medications help with blood sugar management, slow down the movement of food through the gut, and decrease appetite, Dr. Ali explains. While tirzepatide is similar to semaglutide, it also targets an additional receptor (GIP), he says. It’s important to point out that this isn’t the first study to link weight loss medications to vision issues. Research published in July in JAMA Ophthalmology tied semaglutide to NAION. While cases of NAION were low overall, the researchers found that patients with diabetes who used semaglutide were more than four times more likely to develop NAION than people who didn’t take the drug. Patients who were overweight or had obesity were seven times more likely to develop the condition. But the latest study expands on potential vision complications and suggests tirzepatide could also be linked to this health issue. It seems to boil down to treating hyperglycemia, i.e. high blood sugar in patients. “In some cases, it is hypothesized that rapid correction of hyperglycemia induced by these drugs, rather than a toxic effect of the drugs, could be associated with the ophthalmic complications reported,” the study’s authors wrote. Meaning, quickly fixing blood sugar issues that patient may have had could have a big impact on their vision health. This isn’t a new thing, says Christoph Buettner, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the division of endocrinology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. He points out that “rapid correction” of high blood pressure has been previously linked with retinopathy (the leading cause of preventable blindness) and papillitis (inflammation of the optic nerve that can lead to blindness). “Both drugs are very potent drugs that allow you to lose weight and normalize hyperglycemia very rapidly in some patients,” Dr. Buettner says. But Dr. Buettner notes that improving diabetes and overweight or obesity is more likely to improve a person’s eye health—not make it worse or cause blindness. While there are a lot of uncertainties about the links between these medications and blindness, this is “worthy of investigation,” says Howard Krauss, M.D., a surgical neuro-ophthalmologist and director of Pacific Neuroscience Institute’s Eye, Ear & Skull Base Center at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. There are no hard and fast numbers on how common it is for someone to develop blindness on semaglutide or tirzepatide. But doctors stress that this is not a common side effect at all. These complications are “so rare,” says Mir Ali, M.D., a bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. As a result, “it is difficult to delineate the exact mechanism,” he says. Dr. Buettner also points out that he’s never seen this in a patient. “These are very rare complications,” he says. It’s also not clear if having obesity and diabetes makes it more likely that someone may develop one of these complications, he says. Basically, there are a lot of unknowns with this. If you start to notice changes in your vision while taking semaglutide or tirzepatide, Dr. Buettner recommends that you stop taking the medication and contact your doctor immediately. If you’re considering going on one of these medications, Dr. Buettner also recommends talking to your doctor about the pace of your weight loss and blood sugar management. Quickly changing your blood sugar levels may raise the risk of eye issues, which is why it’s so important to be in contact with your doctor about your progress. Your doctor can help control the pace of your weight loss and blood sugar management if things start changing too quickly, Dr. Buettner says. “There are ways to do that by reducing the  dose,” he explains. Again, these serious complications are not common on these medications. But if you start to notice a change in your vision while taking semaglutide or tirzepatide, contact your doctor ASAP.

Here’s what doctors want you to know about taking a buzz A new study a risk of study perfect. into medications. medication new study vision health. First, let’s cover a few basics about these medications. Semaglutide is in a class of medications cnew studyed GLP-1 receptor agonists. These medications mimic a protein in your body cnew studyed glucagon-like peptide 1 (or GLP-1), explains Mir these drugsli, M.D., a bariatric surgeon new study medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Vnew studyey, Cthese drugs. Tirzepatide is in a class of medications cnew studyed glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors. Both medications help from blood sugar management, slow down the movement of food through the gut, new study decrease appetite, Dr. these drugsli explains. While tirzepatide is similar to semaglutide, it also targets an additional receptor (GIP), he says. It’s important to point out that this isn’t the first study to link buzz A new study a risk of study perfect. into medications. medications to vision issues. Research published in July in Jthese drugsMthese drugs Ophthalmology tied semaglutide to Nthese drugsION. While cases of Nthese drugsION were low overnew study, the researchers found that patients from diabetes who used semaglutide were more than four times more likely to develop Nthese drugsION than people who didn’t take the drug. Patients who were overbuzz or had obesity were seven times more likely to develop the condition. But the latest study expnew studys on potential vision complications new study suggests tirzepatide could also be linked to this health issue. It seems to boil down to treating hyperglycemia, i.e. high blood sugar in patients. “In some cases, it is hypothesized that rapid correction of hyperglycemia induced by these drugs, rather than a toxic effect of the drugs, could be associated from the ophthalmic complications reported,” the study’s authors wrote. Meaning, quickly fixing blood sugar issues that patient may have had could have a big impact on their vision health. This isn’t a new thing, says Christoph Buettner, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the division of endocrinology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. He points out that “rapid correction” of high blood pressure has been previously linked from retinopathy (the leading cause of preventable blindness) new study papillitis (inflammation of the cnew studyed nerve that can lead to blindness). “Both drugs are very potent drugs that new studyow you to lose buzz new study normalize hyperglycemia very rapidly in some patients,” Dr. Buettner says. But Dr. Buettner notes that improving diabetes new study overbuzz or obesity is more likely to improve a person’s eye health—not make it worse or cause blindness. While there are a lot of uncertainties about the links between these medications new study blindness, this is “worthy of investigation,” says Howard Krauss, M.D., a surgical neuro-ophthalmologist new study director of Pacific Neuroscience Institute’s Eye, Ear & Skull Base Center at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Cthese drugs. There are no hard new study fast numbers on how common it is for someone to develop blindness on semaglutide or tirzepatide. But doctors stress that this is not a common side effect at new study. These complications are “so rare,” says Mir these drugsli, M.D., a bariatric surgeon new study medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Vnew studyey, Cthese drugs. these drugss a result, “it is difficult to delineate the exact mechanism,” he says.

Singer Avery Reveals Ozempic Left Her With Deadly Bone-Thinning Disease,https://www.ndtv.com/feature/singer-avery-reveals-ozempic-left-her-with-deadly-bone-thinning-disease-7572440,"In an emotional Instagram video, singer Avery tearfully revealed that she has been diagnosed with a debilitating bone-thinning disease after taking Ozempic for a year. The 30-year-old Arizona native confessed that she turned to the weight-loss drug after battling an eating disorder. The singer shared that she was dropped by her record label for ""being too fat"" and confessed, ""I thought I needed Ozempic to be beautiful and successful."" Recent tests revealed she has osteoporosis, a condition that increases the risk of life-threatening fractures. In her video, she urged her 250,000 Instagram followers not to ""make the same mistake"" and take a medication ""you do not need.""  A post shared by Avery (@averyofficial)   Ozempic injections are primarily designed to help people with type 2 diabetes and obesity manage their blood sugar levels and lose weight. However, studies suggest that the drug could lead to brittle bones, prompting experts to warn individuals at risk of fractures against using it. Approximately half a million people in the UK are believed to be using the medication, which has been shown to help users lose up to 20% of their body weight in just a few months. In an Instagram video, the ""Let Me Go"" singer shared that she visited her doctor for a check-up after stopping Ozempic two months ago. She expressed, ""I'm kind of in shock right now because I wasn't expecting this. Ozempic can cause bone density loss, and I didn't think that would happen to me since I was only on it for a year. But I have significant bone loss, osteoporosis, and osteopenia. That's what happens when you use Ozempic for weight loss and lose too much weight."" The singer continued, ""I know some of you might not relate or might think I'm being overdramatic, but I'm sharing this to say please don't take this drug if you don't need it. Please use me as an example. I want to show you why you need to be cautious. It's become very normalized, but it's really dangerous. I just can't believe I did this damage to myself."" In a separate post, she wrote, ""Please, please be careful with Ozempic if you don't need it. It's meant only for diabetes and obesity treatment. I've done a lot of damage to myself. I want to make it clear that I do have an eating disorder and did NOT get Ozempic from a doctor. It's very easy to get now, and many people with eating disorders are using it. I made a mistake, and I take responsibility for it. Please learn from mine. ""I will be starting a treatment plan and going on medication. I'll know more soon. It's not always reversible, but there are things I can do to improve the situation. Right now, I need to be very careful because my bones are brittle. But it is treatable, and I'll be okay.

Ozempic Side Effects - Medical warning: Ozempic and Mounjaro may be linked to vision loss - India Today,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/shows/story/the-buzz-medical-warning-ozempic-and-mounjaro-may-be-linked-to-vision-loss-glbs-2679464-2025-02-13,"Listen to Story Medical experts are raising concerns about the potential dangers of weight loss medications such as Ozempic and Mounjaro following new reports suggesting they may cause severe and possibly permanent vision loss. According to the Daily Mail, research has linked these drugs to conditions that can inflame and obstruct blood flow to the eyes, leading to blindness. A recent study highlighted nine cases of US patients who experienced vision issues after using semaglutide (Ozempic) or tirzepatide (Mounjaro). These findings have intensified concerns about the safety of these widely prescribed medications. Patients' Experiences: Sudden Vision Loss A woman reported losing sight in her left eye just a day after receiving her first semaglutide injection for diabetes. Although she paused the medication for two months, she had to resume it due to her health condition. Within two weeks of restarting, she experienced vision loss in her right eye as well. Another patient, who had been taking semaglutide for a year, woke up one morning with a ""painless shadow"" covering her left eye. Medical examinations revealed extensive damage to the retinal blood vessels, causing blindness. In another case, a man who had been on tirzepatide for a year developed bleeding in his left eye. However, due to a lack of definitive evidence linking the drug to blindness, doctors advised him to continue taking the medication. Uncertain causes but increasing concerns The exact cause of these vision issues remains unknown. However, specialists believe these medications can rapidly lower blood sugar levels, which may damage the blood vessels in the eyes and trigger sudden blindness. A year ago, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommended that patients experiencing vision problems while taking semaglutide stop using the drug and consult a physician. However, they did not suggest discontinuing these medications altogether. Danish health officials are also investigating possible links between semaglutide and vision loss. A recent study found that seven of the nine affected patients had nonarteritic ischemic anterior optic neuropathy (NAION), a condition that restricts blood flow to the optic nerve. Broader side effects of weight loss medications Weight loss drugs have been associated with several unexpected side effects. While blindness is an emerging concern, patients have also reported thyroid tumors, gastric paralysis, suicidal thoughts, sexual dysfunction, and hair loss. With an estimated 15 million Americans using weight loss injections, medical professionals emphasize the urgent need for further research to fully understand the risks associated with these medications.Published By: Rivanshi RakhraiPublished On: Feb 13, 2025Trending Reel","Listen the Sthery the new are the the the Mounjaro the of the suggesting Listen the Sthery Medical experts the the suggesting Listen the Sthery Medical experts Mounjaro the new the suggesting Listen the Sthery Medical experts may cause severe and possibly permanent vision loss.

Side Effects of GLP-1 Drugs: What Doctors Should Know,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/side-effects-glp-1-drugs-what-doctors-should-know-2024a1000l8r,"November 21, 2024 Just a few years after some TikTok videos spiked the demand, one in eight US adults has tried Ozempic (semaglutide) or another drug in its class. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist medications have revolutionized obesity medicine. But they’re not without problems. In the early days of the social media craze, news reports often featured patients whose gastrointestinal side effects sent them to the emergency room (ER). “It happened a lot then. Patients didn’t want to complain because they were losing weight, and they wound up in the ER with extreme constipation or a small bowel obstruction,” said Caroline Apovian, MD, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, Boston. “But that’s not really happening now,” she added. Research backs up her assertion: A recent clinical review of studies found that many patients still experience side effects, but only at a mild to moderate level, while the dosage increases — and the unpleasantness tapers with time. Roughly 7% of patients discontinue the medications due to these symptoms. Here’s what the latest research shows about GLP-1s’ side effects. Depending on the symptom and the specific drug, anywhere from one third to one half of patients will experience some kind of stomach trouble. Apovian finds that careful dosage helps her patients avoid the worst effects. “We don’t know who’s going to do well and who’s not,” she said. “We start slowly, and usually things go OK.” If a patient does react poorly, she’ll hold off on increasing the dosage until they acclimate and advise using over-the-counter meds like MiraLAX to address the symptoms. Few documented severe adverse gastro events appeared in the data, affecting less than 1% of liraglutide and tirzepatide patients and 2.6% of semaglutide users. The majority of these events were gallbladder-related. About a year ago, a study used 18 years’ worth of data from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to examine how often patients reported suicidal ideation and/or depression while using GLP-1 medications. Compared with metformin and insulin, researchers found disproportionate reporting by patients using semaglutide and liraglutide. Other GLP-1 medications didn’t show this effect. The researchers pointed out: These statistics don’t show causation — there’s no clear reason why those two medications were linked to more reports. Further research has been more reassuring: There are several factors at play here. People with obesity and diabetes are more likely to have depression to begin with. And more importantly, even if there is a link, causality remains unclear. For instance, patients who lose weight via bariatric surgery are at increased risk for depression, substance abuse, and self-harm. These symptoms may be related to the weight loss itself, not the medications. “Some people use food as something other than nutrition. They use food to soothe other psychological issues,” Apovian said. “When that’s taken away, the psychological issues are still there.” In her practice, she’s seen the risk for mental health issues rise with more substantial weight loss — 50-100 lb. This lack of clarity regarding causation means it’s important to perform a detailed patient history before prescribing, so you can monitor more closely with preexisting psychiatric disorders. Here, too, the research isn’t definitive but leans toward no clear association. Several studies have looked for a link between GLP-1 and vision-related issues: One drawback with all these studies is that they’re based on large databases rather than randomized controlled trials (RCTs). When researchers focused on RCTs in a 2023 meta-analysis, they found a significant association with only one form of GLP-1, albiglutide — which was withdrawn from the market in 2017. The other six FDA-approved drugs didn’t show a statistically significant link. Earlier this month, the FDA updated labeling for semaglutide, liraglutide, and tirzepatide to include a warning about the risk for aspiration during surgery. While there are no published studies, several case reports have appeared. GLP-1 medications delay gastric emptying, so even though a patient may have fasted before surgery as usual, some food or liquid may remain. In response to this possibility, a group of professional medical societies issued guidelines for using these medications during the perioperative period. They include: And then there are the outliers, the frightening issues that make headlines. On their own, none of these are common enough to affect consideration of GLP-1 use: When you lay out these side effects against the countless known benefits of weight loss and blood sugar management — the lower risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, metabolic syndrome, fatty liver disease, several cancers, and more — the advantages of GLP-1 drugs seem clear. Ultimately, of course, it’s the patient’s decision whether to begin and continue taking any medication for a chronic disease. Apovian recommends having in-depth conversations before you write that first prescription — she compares the situation to using an antihypertensive drug. If your patient understands potential side effects, they’re more likely to maintain long-term compliance. “We educate our patients how to use these drugs, indefinitely, if you want to maintain a lower, healthier body weight,” she said. “I don’t see patients who stop using them, but they’re out there. These are people desperate to lose weight, who aren’t given the education to understand we’re treating a disease. It’s not a matter of willpower.” And once a patient starts taking a GLP-1, monitor them closely, with in-person visits rather than telehealth, while increasing the dosage. If they experience side effects, stay at that level until they ease. And if the patient has a good weight-loss response at a lower dose, stay there. Just because you can go higher, it doesn’t mean you should.

"Weight-loss drug found to shrink heart muscle in mice, human cells | Folio",https://www.ualberta.ca/en/folio/2024/11/weight-loss-drug-found-to-shrink-heart-muscle.html,"U of A researchers urge caution about the unknown unintended negative health consequences of trendy anti-obesity medications. November 18, 2024 By Michael Brown A new U of A study shows that drugs like Ozempic may not just be causing people to lose weight — they may be causing the heart to lose muscle. (Photo: Getty Images) Trendy weight-loss drugs making headlines for shrinking waistlines may also be shrinking the human heart and other muscles, according to a new University of Alberta study whose authors say should serve as a “cautionary tale” about possible long-term health effects of these drugs. “If people have been prescribed these drugs, then the benefits should likely far exceed the risks,” says Jason Dyck, lead author on the study, pediatrics professor in the Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry and a member of the Women and Children’s Health Research Institute. “However, the growing number of people who may be taking these drugs who do not meet the eligibility criteria and who are not at risk have a different risk-reward calculation that they should be made aware of.” Dyck and his team set out to study why a reported side-effect of the leading weight-loss drug Ozempic is the loss of skeletal muscle. Ozempic, known medically as semaglutide, was originally designed to help adult patients with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar. However, this drug — and a host of others in this class of medication — are also being touted for their effectiveness as an anti-obesity medication. Using mice for the study, the researchers found that heart muscle also decreased in both obese and lean mice. The systemic effect observed in mice was then confirmed in cultured human heart cells. Dyck, who is the Canada Research Chair in Molecular Medicine and heads up the Cardiovascular Research Centre, says his team did not observe any detrimental functional effects in hearts of mice with smaller hearts and thus would not expect any overt health effects in humans. But he adds that there may be more impact over the long term, or some forms of cardiac stress may have a detrimental effect that wasn’t observed at rest. “Given the growing number of people taking this drug who have no cardiovascular disease or who are not classified as obese, we suggest that cardiac structure and function be carefully evaluated in previous and ongoing clinical studies.” Dyck’s study comes on the heels of a commentary published in the November issue of The Lancet by an international team of researchers from the U of A, McMaster and Louisiana State University who examined emerging research showing that up to 40 per cent of the weight lost by people using weight-loss drugs is actually muscle. Carla Prado, a nutrition researcher in the Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences and lead author on the commentary, explains this rate of muscle decline is significantly higher than what is typically observed with calorie-reduced diets or normal aging and could lead to a host of long-term health issues — including decreased immunity, increased risk of infections and poor wound healing. “Muscle does much more than just help us move or lift things. It is a powerful organ that keeps us healthy in a number of ways,” she says. For example, muscle stores important building blocks — amino acids — that the body uses when we’re sick, stressed or injured to repair itself and stay strong. It also plays a huge role in managing blood sugar, which helps prevent diabetes. As well, Prado notes muscle releases special molecules called myokines that signal other parts of the body to help fight infections and support our immune system. “That’s why preserving muscle is so important, especially during weight-loss treatments — it’s not just about staying strong, but about keeping our whole body resilient and healthy.” In the commentary, the authors suggest that muscle loss due to weight reduction may also exacerbate conditions like sarcopenic obesity — characterized by a combination of high body fat and low skeletal muscle mass — which contributes to poorer health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and higher mortality rates. Though the short-term effects of muscle loss on physical strength and function remain unclear, the commentary calls for future research to explore how reductions in muscle mass might improve muscle mass and composition. To keep muscle strong while losing weight, Prado says it is essential to focus on two main things: nutrition and exercise. Proper nutrition means getting enough high-quality protein, essential vitamins and minerals, and other “muscle-building” nutrients. Sometimes, this can include protein supplements to make sure the body has what it needs. “Exercise is just as important — specifically resistance training like lifting weights or using resistance bands,” said Prado, who was recently named Canada Research Chair in Integrative Nutrition, Body Composition and Energy Metabolism. “This type of exercise helps keep muscle from breaking down during weight loss and maintains strength.” She adds that for anyone using weight loss medications, it’s best to follow a balanced program that includes both enough protein and resistance training. “This can help people lose fat while minimizing muscle loss, which helps them get the full health benefits of treatment and stay strong.” Prado, who is a member of the Cancer Research Institute of Northern Alberta, the Women and Children’s Health Research Institute, the Alberta Diabetes Institute, the Alberta Transplant Institute and the Institute of Sensory Motor Rehabilitative Technology, is collaborating with Dyck to explore the mechanisms and impact of various forms of muscle wasting in relation to this class of medication.

"Ozempic side effects: Benefits, risks revealed in new study",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/01/22/ozempic-side-effects-benefits-risks/77746053007/,"You may take Ozempic or another drug to control your diabetes or lose weight, but these so-called GLP-1s also have a host of other effects ‒ some good and some not so good. A new study, the first to catalogue these risks and benefits, confirmed that these drugs are associated with a lower risk of heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular problems. People who took the medicines also had fewer seizures and addictions to alcohol, cannabis and opioids, according to the study, published Monday in the journal Nature. The research, which compared about 2 million veterans with diabetes, some of whom took the drugs and some didn't, found the medications were also associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. More:Medicare targets popular weight loss drugs Ozempic, Wegovy for price negotiations These diabetes and weight loss drugs work by slowing digestion and curbing appetite, said the study's senior author, Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University School of Medicine and chief of research at the VA Saint Louis Health Care System. It’s possible that by reducing food cravings, they may also reduce cravings for other substances like alcohol, he said. Most people saw a modest 10% to 20% reduction in the risk of these health problems ‒ perhaps because of the drugs themselves, or because of the general health benefits that come with losing excess body weight, Al-Aly said. Or maybe both. “The two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive,” he said. On the flip side, the study found that these drugs, known as GLP-1s, are also associated with an increased risk of several negative health outcomes and side effects. The most common were the well-known gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and gastroparesis, or stomach paralysis. Monica Church, 56, knows about these side effects firsthand. The Goodrich, Michigan resident was hospitalized after taking the medication in December 2023 because she couldn’t keep down any food or fluids. She still has stomach pain when she eats certain foods or is under any stress. “It’s still wreaking havoc on my body,” she said. Researchers also found the medications were associated with an increased risk of low blood pressure, arthritic disorders, and pancreas and kidney problems. The study is the first to map out all the potential benefits and risks associated with this class of medications. Now that health experts have this “atlas” of information, Al-Aly hopes more research is done to better understand how these drugs can impact multiple parts of the body. “This really should serve as a wake-up call for regulators to demand companies to take a more comprehensive look,” he said. In a statement sent to USA TODAY, a spokesperson for drug maker Novo Nordisk said the company welcomes any independent research investigating the safety and efficacy of their products, which include Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss. The company said it's exploring the use of semaglutide, a type of GLP-1, for other diseases such as chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and Alzheimer's disease, among others. Eli Lilly, which manufactures Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss, did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment about the research. This story was updated to add new information.

"Study Confirms Pancreatitis, Kidney Damage Ozempic Side Effects",https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63545361/pancreatitis-kidney-damage-ozempic-study/,"They're “very rare.” Women's Health may earn commission from the links on this page, but we only feature products we believe in. Why Trust Us? Most people know that GLP-1 receptor agonist medications like Ozempic and Wegovy can cause relatively minor side effects like nausea and diarrhea. But new research confirms that more serious complications—like pancreatitis and kidney damage—are real. It's important to point out that most people who use GLP-1 receptor agonist medications do not experience these side effects. But, of course, you should be aware of all potential risks before using a medication. Here’s what the study suggests, plus what a weight loss physician wants you to know. Meet the expert: Mir Ali, MD, is the medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. The study, which was published in Nature Medicine on January 20, analyzed data from more than 2 million people with diabetes who took GLP-1 receptor agonist medications like Ozempic and Wegovy. The researchers found that these medications helped lower the risk of developing 42 different health conditions or outcomes, including dementia, cardiac arrest, and certain kinds of cancer. But they also discovered that people who took these medications had a higher risk of developing 19 different negative health outcomes. Those included nausea and vomiting, kidney stones, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), sleep issues, stomach cramps, pancreatitis, and gastroparesis (i.e. stomach paralysis). These findings are “consistent with other studies previously done,” says Mir Ali, MD, the medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. The risk of developing both of these conditions while taking a GLP-1 receptor agonist medication is low. But research has generally shown that the risk of developing pancreatitis while taking this medication is less than one percent. Reports of kidney damage have largely been limited to case reports, suggesting they’re extremely rare. Of course, it’s possible to have side effects on Ozempic without becoming seriously ill. According to the Ozempic website, more common side effects include: Everyone reacts to these medications differently, Ali says. However, he says you can often lower your risk of side effects by staying well hydrated, eating smaller meals, and limiting processed foods, high-fat foods, and refined carbohydrates. Another thing to keep in mind: Side effects, if you do experience them, tend to ease in a few weeks when your body gets used to the medication, per Ali. “I do believe the benefits outweigh the risks; although gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, diarrhea or constipation are common, they are manageable, for the most part,” Ali says. “More serious side effects like pancreatitis and kidney complications are very rare.” Amy Schumer Had This Reaction To Ozempic How Ozempic Is Changing Grocery Store Shopping How Ozempic Could Lower Dementia Risk Everything Dolores Catania Has Said About Ozempic How To Build Muscle On Ozempic Can You Go On Ozempic If You Want To Get Pregnant?

Can Ozempic Lead To Hair Loss? Hear It From The Expert | OnlyMyHealth,https://www.onlymyhealth.com/how-can-ozempic-cause-hair-loss-12977823677,"Have you noticed more hair shedding than usual while taking Ozempic and wondered if the two are connected? Ozempic, known for its benefits in managing type 2 diabetes and aiding weight loss, has sparked conversations about potential side effects, including hair loss. Though this isn’t an officially recognised side effect, some users have raised concerns. To demystify this, we spoke to Dr Pranav A Ghody, Endocrinologist, Wockhardt Hospital, Mumbai Central, who explained this link and how you can protect your hair while staying on track with your health goals.  According to a 2017 study, Ozempic (semaglutide) is a medication that helps adults with type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar levels. It gives best results when combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise. The drug comes in a prefilled pen containing a liquid, making it easy to use.  “Hair loss may not be a commonly reported side effect of Ozempic, however, some people on the medication have experienced thinning hair or increased shedding. It is likely not a direct consequence of the drug itself but could be attributed to other factors, such as rapid weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, or underlying health conditions,” explained Dr Ghody.  Hair loss during Ozempic treatment is often associated with rapid weight loss rather than the medication. “When the body undergoes significant changes, such as rapid weight reduction, it may prioritise essential functions over hair growth, leading to temporary shedding. This condition is called telogen effluvium and is common during physical or emotional stress,” said Dr Ghody. According to a 2020 study, telogen effluvium is a scalp disorder involving excessive hair shedding and is one of the common causes of alopecia. Not only this, according to the American Hair Loss Association (AHLA), hormonal changes caused by Ozempic and similar medications may also trigger early signs of male and female pattern hair loss, known as androgenic alopecia. Androgenic alopecia is a progressive condition that can worsen over time, leading to permanent hair loss. Also Read: What is ‘Ozempic Butt’? Expert Shares Tips On How To Manage This Side Effect To prevent or reduce hair loss, consider the following expert-recommended tips:  Do not neglect the benefits of a nutrient-rich diet. Make sure to include adequate protein, iron, and vitamins like biotin and zinc. You can supplement with nutrients if you identify any deficiencies through tests. Maintain a gradual and sustainable weight loss plan to avoid undue stress on the body. Consult your healthcare provider to rule out other causes of hair loss, such as hormonal imbalances or thyroid dysfunction.  If you notice significant hair loss while using Ozempic, it’s essential to consult a healthcare professional. They can identify potential underlying causes and recommend effective treatments. Also Read: Do Plucking Out Grey Hair Lead More To Grow? We Asked Expert Bottomline Dr Ghody concluded, “While Ozempic itself is unlikely to cause hair loss, rapid weight loss and related nutritional changes might contribute to thinning hair. Addressing these factors with a well-balanced diet and professional guidance can help you enjoy the benefits of Ozempic without compromising overall health. Always discuss any concerns with your doctor for tailored advice.” [Disclaimer: This article contains information provided by an expert and is for informational purposes only.

The dangerous side effects of Ozempic-like fat jabs revealed - as major crackdown announced | The Sun,https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/33269583/fat-jabs-dangers-revealed-crackdown/,"WEIGHT-loss jabs are taking the world by storm, with a staggering half a million of us now using them. The injections have allegedly helped celebrities including Sun columnist Jeremy Clarkson, Sharon Osbourne, Elon Musk and ex-Prime Minister Boris Johnson to slim down. But worrying data has revealed a huge rise in the number of people hospitalised after taking the medication. Nearly 400 users have ended up in A&E since the drugs were introduced in 2019. There was a sharp rise towards the end of last year, with 118 cases in October and November alone. Side effects reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency also increased by 19 per cent and included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, seizures and pancreatitis, which can be fatal. A small percentage of patients have fallen into comas after going into hypoglycemic shock. While more than 500,000 of us use “skinny jabs”, it’s thought only five per cent have them prescribed, with others buying them online. This has prompted a tightening of restrictions on their sale, with video or face-to-face chats now mandatory. The General Pharmaceutical Council this week said too many people are pretending to be obese to get weight-loss jabs. So are these injections really wonder drugs? To help you separate fact from fiction, we asked Dr Helen Wall, resident GP on BBC Breakfast and senior partner at a health centre in Bolton, and Dr Aishah Iqbal, a weight-loss coach from Mind Over Diets, to answer key questions on the “miracle” jabs. WHETHER it’s Wegovy, Mounjaro or Saxenda, all jabs have one thing in common — they mimic a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1. “Wegovy is the brand name for semaglutide, a drug used initially for type 2 diabetes but now also used for weight management,” Dr Iqbal tells Sun on Sunday Health. “It delays gastric emptying, creating a suppression in appetite, making you feel fuller for longer. Ozempic is another brand name for semaglutide. While it’s licensed for weight loss in the US, it is strictly meant to be prescribed for diabetes control in the UK. “Mounjaro works in the same way but uses tirzepatide, while the active ingredient in Saxenda is liraglutide.” Trial results showed Wegovy could lead to 15 per cent weight loss, and Mounjaro to 23 per cent. THESE drugs are available on the NHS, but only in restricted cases, such as for patients with type 2 diabetes. “Otherwise you have to go through a specialist weight-loss service and you will need to meet certain criteria — having a BMI over 35 or a BMI over 30 and other health conditions like heart disease or type 2 diabetes,” Dr Iqbal says. “It’s a tight process, prompting people to look elsewhere.” SOME scientists have hailed the jabs as “miraculous”. And they can be life-changing for people who are obese, have serious health problems or are heading towards bariatric surgery. “Short-term benefits include improved self-esteem, confidence and mental health,” Dr Wall says. “People often find they are better able to run around after their children, and joint issues and back pain improve. Patients also significantly reduce their risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, heart attack and cancers linked to obesity, like bowel and womb.” IN short, no. In many cases, people regain weight within 12 months of stopping the medication, trials show. “A lot of people with obesity have other issues and as well as medication. They have to change their lifestyle and address their psychological relationship with food,” Dr Wall says. NAUSEA, vomiting, constipation and abdominal pain are the most commonly reported side effects. In trials, three quarters of patients given a 2.4mg weekly dose of semaglutide experienced gastrointestinal discomfort. “For some people, this only lasts a couple of weeks, and others don’t get symptoms at all,” Dr Wall says. “Rarer but more serious consequences include pancreatitis, which can lead to hospitalisation and, in the worst cases, death.” Research by Massachusetts Eye and Ear hospital discovered a link between semaglutide and an eye condition, which can cause blindness. Doctors found people with type 2 diabetes taking the drug were four times more likely to be diagnosed with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), and those who were overweight or obese were seven times more likely to develop it. A separate study by Washington University showed patients taking weight-loss jabs had an increased risk of 19 illnesses, including arthritis, and damage to the gut and kidneys. The risk of pancreatitis — a life-threatening swelling of the pancreas — was doubled. Anecdotally, some users have complained of sagging skin and sunken eyes, dubbed “Ozempic face” on social media, while others have reported severe hair loss. The packaging also mentions gallbladder problems, kidney failure and depression as potential side effects. Dr Wall adds: “The drugs are still relatively new and more things may come out the more they are prescribed. Only time will tell.” IF you can tolerate them, be patient. “Give it time and often these symptoms improve,” Dr Wall says. “But if you have severe pain or significant vomiting, seek medical advice as these drugs can have serious consequences.” MANY online pharmacies sell weight-loss jabs. “If they are qualified to prescribe, that’s fine,” Dr Wall says. “The worry is lots of these companies aren’t doing their due diligence. ""Currently, all you have to do is fill out an online form with your weight and BMI. But people can put in what they want and no one checks. “The drugs are also popular on the black market and some people aren’t getting the drug they think they are. Never buy them from a beauty salon.” “IF you are a normal weight or even slightly overweight, then remember the risks are very real,” Dr Wall says. “These are serious medications. It might sound like a quick fix but you won’t maintain the weight loss unless you look at the reasons you got to this point in the first place. “It’s definitely not something you should take for aesthetic reasons or before a holiday.” SPEAK to your GP and ask if there’s a specialist weight management service in your area. “Whether or not you qualify will vary depending on where you live,” Dr Wall says. “If you do, you will get the full package — not just the injections, but emotional support and lifestyle and dietary advice, which is key to keeping the weight off long-term. ""If you don’t qualify, you may want to access the jabs privately.  “I’m not against that as the NHS does not necessarily cater for everyone. However, pick a provider who is registered and fully qualified, such as a pharmacist, private GP or weight-loss clinic. “Don’t just pop your BMI into a Facebook search and get syringes delivered the next day.

Semaglutide Side Effects: Is It Safe? What You Need To Know,https://www.aol.com/semaglutide-side-effects-safe-know-145700367.html,"This article was reviewed by Craig Primack, MD, FACP, FAAP, FOMA.  Semaglutide — the active ingredient in the brand-name meds Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus — treats type 2 diabetes and obesity or overweight. If you’ve recently been prescribed this medication or are curious about getting a prescription, you probably have some questions about semaglutide side effects. While semaglutide can be a life-changing tool and is generally considered safe and effective when taken as prescribed, side effects like nausea and upset stomach are common in the beginning. Though they typically subside after a few weeks to months. We’ll talk about how semaglutide works and go over the common side effects you might encounter — as well as some rare but more serious risks to be aware of. Knowledge is power, and we’re here to help you feel informed and confident in your treatment journey. Let’s dive in. Semaglutide is in a class called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. It works by mimicking GLP-1, a hormone the intestines naturally make. GLP-1 plays a key role in stimulating insulin production and regulating blood sugar levels (glucose). It also suppresses appetite and boosts feelings of fullness, which can then lead to reduced food intake and potential weight loss. Ozempic, Wegovy, and compounded semaglutide are once-weekly injections. Rybelsus, on the other hand, is taken orally once a day. Semaglutide is used to treat both type 2 diabetes and obesity. Wegovy is FDA-approved for weight management in people with a BMI (body mass index) of 30 or higher or 27 or higher if they have at least one weight-related medical condition, such as: High blood pressure (hypertension) Type 2 diabetes High cholesterol Sleep apnea Ozempic is FDA-approved for type 2 diabetes, but since it also contains semaglutide, it’s often prescribed off-label to help support weight management. Off-label is when a provider prescribes a medication for something other than what it was FDA-approved to treat. Both Wegovy and Ozempic are prescribed alongside lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and increased physical activity. Compounded semaglutide contains the same active ingredient as Wegovy and Ozempic. Healthcare providers usually start patients on a low dose of semaglutide and gradually increase it every four weeks until they reach a long-term maintenance dose. This can help mitigate some semaglutide side effects. The recommended maintenance dose of Wegovy is 2.4 milligrams (mg) weekly. But not everyone will need such a high dose to achieve their weight loss goals. It’s not uncommon to experience some adverse effects with semaglutide, especially during the first few weeks of treatment or when adjusting to a higher dose. The most common side effects of Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus are gastrointestinal, including things like: Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Constipation Stomach pain It’s important to be aware of these initial reactions as your body adapts to the medication. When in doubt, keep your provider in the loop. They may be able to help you find ways to manage the side effects if they don’t go away on their own. Semaglutide injection side effects — like skin irritation — can also occur at the injection site. Side effects from semaglutide are expected at the beginning of treatment and when you increase your dose (if they occur at all). Thankfully, many people find that their side effects subside after a few weeks as their bodies get used to the medication. Some folks taking semaglutide manage nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain by using over-the-counter medications during the adjustment period. But there are also prescription options. It’s always a good idea to keep in close communication with your healthcare provider about any side effects you experience. If your side effects are particularly severe, they may suggest slowing down your dose escalation to help your body adapt more comfortably. If you’re experiencing semaglutide nausea or you’re worried about starting semaglutide because of this potential side effect, your healthcare provider may recommend a prescription anti-nausea medication like Zofran (ondansetron). Zofran has been FDA-approved for decades to help with the nausea and vomiting associated with cancer treatment, radiation, and surgery, but is often prescribed off-label for general nausea. Zofran can be taken as needed to help reduce nausea associated with GLP-1 treatment. It typically takes effect within 30 to 60 minutes. If your provider determines you’re a good fit, you’ll receive a packet of 20 dissolvable pills with your weight loss medication. If you need a refill, you can reach out to a provider. Now, you may be wondering about the rare long-term side effects of semaglutide. This medication is generally considered safe, and the benefits of taking semaglutide outweigh the risks for most people. But there’s still a possibility of more serious side effects. According to research cited in the FDA’s prescribing information for Ozempic, some severe side effects and long-term risks include: Pancreatitis Acute kidney injury Gallbladder problems Diabetic retinopathy complications Increased heart rate Thyroid cancer Mental health issues Here’s what’s known so far about these effects. Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) was reported during clinical trials of Ozempic. However, the findings weren’t conclusive. Translation: If pancreatitis is a potential risk, it appears to be very rare. In a two-year clinical trial of Ozempic, acute pancreatitis — a sudden but treatable condition — was observed in a small number of patients taking Ozempic, but more cases of pancreatitis were observed in patients given a placebo. In other words, more cases of pancreatitis were reported among those on the placebo than those using semaglutide, making it difficult to determine whether the medication was a contributing factor. No cases of pancreatitis were reported in another two-year trial sponsored by Novo Nordisk. This trial involved participants who had obesity or overweight along with at least one weight-related health issue (excluding type 2 diabetes), who were given a 2.4 mg dose of semaglutide. We should note that semaglutide hasn’t been studied in people with a history of pancreatitis. But if you’ve had this condition, your healthcare provider may suggest an alternative treatment. Some studies sponsored by Novo Nordisk suggest that semaglutide may actually help reduce the risk of kidney disease over the long term. But there have also been reports of individuals taking GLP-1 medications, like semaglutide, who developed kidney issues, including worsening chronic kidney failure, especially if experiencing significant nausea or vomiting. Acute kidney injury is when the kidneys suddenly stop functioning properly. There have been instances of kidney problems showing up in people experiencing significant nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea — conditions that can lead to dehydration and negatively impact kidney function. If you have a history of kidney problems, let your healthcare provider know before starting semaglutide. And if you experience severe gastrointestinal side effects, your provider may want to monitor your kidney function closely to ensure everything stays on track. Your gallbladder is in your abdomen. It stores and releases bile, which is needed to break down fats in the food you eat. One of the rarer side effects of semaglutide is related to gallbladder health, specifically gallstones — hardened pieces of bile that develop over time. According to research, losing a significant amount of weight quickly can increase the risk of gallbladder issues, including gallstones. In clinical trials supported by Novo Nordisk, gallstones were reported in 1.5 percent of participants taking a 0.5 mg dose of semaglutide and 0.4 percent of those taking the 1 mg dose. No cases of gallstones were reported among those who received a placebo. Also, semaglutide may raise the risk of gallbladder disease. In further clinical trials from Novo Nordisk, 83 people taking semaglutide experienced gallbladder-related events (mainly gallstones), compared to just 39 patients on a placebo. While many people with gallstones may not experience symptoms, it’s important to know that if a gallstone blocks your bile ducts, you might feel pain in your upper-right abdomen. If anything feels unusual, reach out to your healthcare provider. Diabetic retinopathy is a serious eye condition that can affect folks with diabetes. It happens when blood vessels in the eyes are damaged, potentially leading to vision loss. Semaglutide may increase the risk of complications related to diabetic retinopathy. In a two-year trial funded by Novo Nordisk, participants with type 2 diabetes and a high cardiovascular risk reported more events of diabetic retinopathy complications while taking semaglutide compared to those on a placebo. Your risk is also higher if you have a history of diabetic retinopathy. And rapid improvements in glucose control — something that can occur with semaglutide — might temporarily worsen diabetic retinopathy. However, the long-term effects of semaglutide on this condition haven’t been thoroughly studied, so we don’t know if sustained glucose control will improve the situation over time. There’s hope for more clarity soon, though. A study investigating the long-term effects of semaglutide on diabetic retinopathy is currently in progress and expected to conclude in 2027. If you have a history of diabetic retinopathy, inform your healthcare provider before starting Ozempic. And if you’re already taking it, seek medical advice right away if you notice any changes in your vision. Taking semaglutide may lead to a slight increase in heart rate — typically by two to three beats per minute, based on trials sponsored by Novo Nordisk using 0.5 and 1 mg doses of semaglutide. The reassuring news is that this small increase hasn’t been linked to any adverse cardiac events. In fact, the benefits of GLP-1 medications like semaglutide on heart health often outweigh the risks of a modest rise in heart rate. Long-term use of semaglutide may even lower the risk of major cardiovascular events like heart attacks, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes. The Wegovy drug label indicates that suicidal ideation and behaviors have been reported in clinical trials of other weight loss treatments. There may also be concerns about other long-term mental health issues, but more research is needed to fully understand these effects. In clinical trials sponsored by Novo Nordisk, semaglutide was compared to liraglutide — another medication used for diabetes and weight loss. Six percent of people taking semaglutide experienced psychiatric disorders over one to four years, compared to 15 percent of those taking liraglutide and 11 percent of the participants taking a placebo. The most commonly reported psychiatric disorders included: Anxiety Depression Insomnia Before starting semaglutide, discuss any history of mental health issues with your healthcare provider. If you notice any mood changes, experience worsening depression, or have thoughts of self-harm while taking this medication, reach out to a healthcare professional. Your mental well-being is just as important as your physical health, and support is available. Ozempic carries a black box warning from the FDA (the FDA’s most serious warning). It says that semaglutide has caused thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents after long-term and high dose exposure to the drug. That said, it’s unclear whether semaglutide poses the same risk to humans, and more research is needed to fully understand this. When it comes to semaglutide side effects, cancer is an unproven risk. Still, it’s helpful to be aware of the symptoms associated with thyroid tumors, which can include: A mass in the neck Difficulty swallowing A persistent hoarse voice Shortness of breath In the meantime, if you have a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2) — both extremely rare types of thyroid tumors — your medical provider will probably encourage you to avoid using semaglutide medications. You might wonder how the side effects of semaglutide for weight loss compare to those of tirzepatide medications like Mounjaro and Zepbound, both made by Eli Lilly. Like semaglutide, tirzepatide is used to treat type 2 diabetes and aid weight loss in those with overweight or obesity. Mounjaro is approved for type 2 diabetes and often prescribed off-label for weight loss. Zepbound is FDA-approved for weight loss in adults with obesity or overweight who have a weight-related condition. The side effects of semaglutide are quite similar to those of tirzepatide, as the drugs work similarly. Both target the GLP-1 receptor, but tirzepatide also targets the insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor, making it a GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist. By mimicking both hormones, tirzepatide helps reduce appetite and food intake, promoting weight loss, as noted in Eli Lilly-sponsored studies. Common side effects for both semaglutide and tirzepatide include nausea and diarrhea, which can be more pronounced at higher doses. Over five percent of people report these symptoms with 2 milligrams or less of semaglutide, while up to 10 percent experience them with tirzepatide. Also, in a 40-week trial comparing tirzepatide to semaglutide in individuals with type 2 diabetes, those on tirzepatide lost more weight. But the study also found that five to seven percent of tirzepatide users experienced serious side effects, compared to three percent of semaglutide users. Yes, semaglutide is generally considered safe for long-term use. Like any medication, it may come with potential side effects and risks. But for many individuals struggling with overweight and obesity, the benefits of losing weight with semaglutide often outweigh those risks. A comprehensive review of clinical trials involving semaglutide — specifically the 2.4 mg dose used for Wegovy — highlighted that one of the drug’s significant advantages is its effectiveness for long-term weight management. Though more extensive research is still needed, a study conducted by Novo Nordisk over four years suggests that Wegovy is safe for long-term use. While compounded semaglutide hasn’t been FDA-approved, compounded drugs from state-licensed pharmacies that stick to the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) guidelines are considered safe. The compounded semaglutide available on the Hers platform has the same active ingredient found in Ozempic and Wegovy. And it’s produced in FDA-regulated compounding pharmacies. It’s possible to regain some of the weight you lost while taking semaglutide once you stop treatment. A Novo Nordisk study included 2,000 participants with obesity or overweight and a weight-related health condition (excluding type 2 diabetes) who were given a 2.4 mg dose of semaglutide for 68 weeks. They were examined after stopping the medication and healthy lifestyle changes. The findings showed that, on average, participants regained two-thirds of the weight they’d lost within a year of stopping both the medication and their healthy habits. This may seem discouraging, but keep in mind that weight regain often happens when people don’t maintain healthy lifestyles. By focusing on nutritious meals, including an emphasis on protein intake and regular exercise, you can significantly improve your chances of keeping the weight off. Staying committed to a healthy lifestyle can make a big difference in your long-term journey. All these semaglutide side effects can sound overwhelming. But remember, they’re pretty rare — the severe ones, at least — and this medication is considered safe. Here’s what else to keep in mind: The most common side effects of semaglutide are gastrointestinal. They’re often temporary and usually subside over time. There are potential long-term side effects of semaglutide. These are rare. They include pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, gallbladder problems, increased heart rate, diabetic retinopathy, mental health issues, and thyroid cancer. Semaglutide subcutaneous injections are recommended as a long-term weight management treatment. They’re designed to help people lose and keep off weight. More long-term research is needed, but studiesspanning four years indicate the drug’s safety. The benefits of semaglutide may outweigh its risks. Semaglutide can help you lose weight. So if you have overweight or obesity, the drug might improve your health and quality of life in many ways, outweighing potential long-term risks. Stay informed about the potential risks of any drug you’re taking. If you have any concerns, discuss them with your healthcare provider. They can help determine if semaglutide is right for you, answer questions, and talk through any of your worries.

If you’re experiencwasg semaglutide nausea or you’re worried about startwasg semaglutide because of this potential side effect, your healthcare provider may recommend a prescription anti-nausea medication like Zofran (ondansetron). Zofran has been FDA-approved for decades to help with This article was reviewed by nausea and vomitwasg associated with cancer treatment, radiation, and surgery, but is often prescribed off-label for general nausea. Zofran can be taken as needed to help reduce nausea associated with GLP-1 treatment. It typically takes effect withwas 30 to 60 mwasutes. If your provider determwases you’re a good fit, you’ll receive a packet of 20 dissolvable pills with your weight loss medication. If you need a refill, you can reach out to a provider. Now, you may be wonderwasg about This article was reviewed by rare long-term side effects of semaglutide. This medication is generally considered safe, and This article was reviewed by benefits of takwasg semaglutide outweigh This article was reviewed by risks for most people. But This article was reviewed byre’s still a possibility of more serious side effects. Accordwasg to research cited was This article was reviewed by FDA’s prescribwasg wasformation for Ozempic, some severe side effects and long-term risks wasclude: Pancreatitis Acute kidney wasjury Gallbladder problems Diabetic retwasopathy complications Increased heart rate Thyroid cancer Mental health issues Here’s what’s known so far about This article was reviewed byse effects. Pancreatitis (wasflammation of This article was reviewed by pancreas) was reported durwasg clwasical trials of Ozempic. However, This article was reviewed by fwasdwasgs weren’t conclusive. Translation: If pancreatitis is a potential risk, it appears to be very rare. In a two-year clwasical trial of Ozempic, acute pancreatitis — a sudden but treatable condition — was observed was a small number of patients takwasg Ozempic, but more cases of pancreatitis were observed was patients given a placebo. In oThis article was reviewed byr words, more cases of pancreatitis were reported among those on This article was reviewed by placebo than those uswasg semaglutide, makwasg it difficult to determwase wheThis article was reviewed byr This article was reviewed by medication was a contributwasg factor. No cases of pancreatitis were reported was anoThis article was reviewed byr two-year trial sponsored by Novo Nordisk. This trial wasvolved participants who had This or overweight along with at least one weight-related health issue (excludwasg type 2 This was — treats type), who were given a 2.4 mg dose of semaglutide. We should note that semaglutide hasn’t been studied was people with a history of pancreatitis. But if you’ve had this condition, your healthcare provider may suggest an alternative treatment. Some studies sponsored by Novo Nordisk suggest that semaglutide may actually help reduce This article was reviewed by risk of kidney disease over This article was reviewed by long term. But This article was reviewed byre have also been reports of wasdividuals takwasg GLP-1 medications, like semaglutide, who developed kidney issues, wascludwasg worsenwasg chronic kidney failure, especially if experiencwasg significant nausea or vomitwasg. Acute kidney wasjury is when This article was reviewed by kidneys suddenly stop functionwasg properly. There have been wasstances of kidney problems showwasg up was people experiencwasg significant nausea, vomitwasg, or diarrhea — conditions that can lead to dehydration and negatively impact kidney function. If you have a history of kidney problems, let your healthcare provider know before startwasg semaglutide. And if you experience severe gastrowastestwasal side effects, your provider may want to monitor your kidney function closely to ensure everythwasg stays on track. Your gallbladder is was your abdomen. It stores and releases bile, which is needed to break down fats was This article was reviewed by food you eat. One of This article was reviewed by rarer side effects of semaglutide is related to gallbladder health, specifically gallstones — hardened pieces of bile that develop over time. Accordwasg to research, loswasg a significant amount of weight quickly can wascrease This article was reviewed by risk of gallbladder issues, wascludwasg gallstones. In clwasical trials supported by Novo Nordisk, gallstones were reported was 1.5 percent of participants takwasg a 0.5 mg dose of semaglutide and 0.4 percent of those takwasg This article was reviewed by 1 mg dose. No cases of gallstones were reported among those who received a placebo. Also, semaglutide may raise This article was reviewed by risk of gallbladder disease. In furThis article was reviewed byr clwasical trials from Novo Nordisk, 83 people takwasg semaglutide experienced gallbladder-related events (mawasly gallstones), compared to just 39 patients on a placebo. While many people with gallstones may not experience symptoms, it’s important to know that if a gallstone blocks your bile ducts, you might feel pawas was your upper-right abdomen.

Your risk is also higher if you have a history of diabetic retwasopathy. And rapid improvements was glucose control — somethwasg that can occur with semaglutide — might temporarily worsen diabetic retwasopathy. However, This article was reviewed by long-term effects of semaglutide on this condition haven’t been thoroughly studied, so we don’t know if sustawased glucose control will improve This article was reviewed by situation over time. There’s hope for more clarity soon, though. A study wasvestigatwasg This article was reviewed by long-term effects of semaglutide on diabetic retwasopathy is currently was progress and expected to conclude was 2027. If you have a history of diabetic retwasopathy, wasform your healthcare provider before startwasg Ozempic.

Takwasg semaglutide may lead to a slight wascrease was heart rate — typically by two to three beats per mwasute, based on trials sponsored by Novo Nordisk uswasg 0.5 and 1 mg doses of semaglutide. The reassurwasg news is that this small wascrease hasn’t been lwasked to any adverse cardiac events. In fact, This article was reviewed by benefits of GLP-1 medications like semaglutide on heart health often outweigh This article was reviewed by risks of a modest rise was heart rate.

You might wonder how This article was reviewed by side effects of semaglutide for weight loss compare to those of tirzepatide medications like Mounjaro and Zepbound, both made by Eli Lilly. Like semaglutide, tirzepatide is used to treat type 2 This was — treats type and aid weight loss was those with overweight or This. Mounjaro is approved for type 2 This was — treats type and often prescribed off-label for weight loss. Zepbound is FDA-approved for weight loss was adults with This or overweight who have a weight-related condition. The side effects of semaglutide are quite similar to those of tirzepatide, as This article was reviewed by drugs work similarly. Both target This article was reviewed by GLP-1 receptor, but tirzepatide also targets This article was reviewed by wassulwasotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor, makwasg it a GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist. By mimickwasg both hormones, tirzepatide helps reduce appetite and food wastake, promotwasg weight loss, as noted was Eli Lilly-sponsored studies. Common side effects for both semaglutide and tirzepatide wasclude nausea and diarrhea, which can be more pronounced at higher doses. Over five percent of people report This article was reviewed byse symptoms with 2 milligrams or less of semaglutide, while up to 10 percent experience This article was reviewed bym with tirzepatide.

But for many wasdividuals strugglwasg with overweight and This, This article was reviewed by benefits of loswasg weight with semaglutide often outweigh those risks. A comprehensive review of clwasical trials wasvolvwasg semaglutide — specifically This article was reviewed by 2.4 mg dose used for Wegovy — highlighted that one of This article was reviewed by drug’s significant advantages is its effectiveness for long-term weight management. Though more extensive research is still needed, a study conducted by Novo Nordisk over four years suggests that Wegovy is safe for long-term use. While compounded semaglutide hasn’t been FDA-approved, compounded drugs from state-licensed pharmacies that stick to This article was reviewed by FDA’s Current Good Manufacturwasg Practice (CGMP) guidelwases are considered safe.

Why do Ozempic and Wegovy seem to treat everything? | New Scientist,https://www.newscientist.com/article/2456669-why-do-ozempic-and-wegovy-seem-to-treat-everything/,"From Alzheimer's disease to depression to heart disease, Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonist drugs appear to offer a solution. Can one type of drug really tackle so many conditions, and if so, how does it actually work? By Helen Thomson 3 December 2024 Pâté Pâté It is rare that a drug becomes a household name and even rarer for one to become a superstar, but with its ability to grab headlines, Ozempic is the Taylor Swift of pharmaceuticals. So just what lies behind its star power? Even as the drug and its derivatives take off, researchers are racing to find out how it works. “We’re seeing so many incredible benefits,” says Steven Dayan at the University of Illinois. “It’s early days, but it’s looking like these drugs aren’t just going to change medicine but our whole economy.” Most medicines only treat one or two conditions, meaning that “cure-alls” promising to tackle any and all ailments are usually viewed with scepticism and suspicion. Ozempic seems to buck that trend. Last year, Wegovy – a version of Ozempic approved for weight loss – was shown to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke by almost 20 per cent. The emergence of “Ozempic pregnancies” hinted at fertility benefits. People started noticing positive effects on depression and anxiety. In May, results showed it also slashed the risk of kidney failure and death in people with diabetes during a three-year trial. In July, another version of the drug was found to reduce brain shrinkage and slow cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease.

"'Weight' & Watch: Indian Pharma Set To Enter Ozempic, Wegovy Market, But Swift Price Crash Unlikely - News18",https://www.news18.com/india/weight-watch-indian-pharma-set-to-enter-ozempic-wegovy-market-but-swift-price-crash-unlikely-9113969.html,"Indian drugmakers are preparing for the launch of copycat weight-loss drugs as the world moves towards the patent expiry of Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster brands Ozempic and Wegovy. The Danish firm’s patents for semaglutide, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in its star brands, will start expiring in Asia (including India) and Africa in 2026 and in the US in 2030. While all eyes are on the Indian industry – known for its ability to produce generic drugs at a fraction of the cost – to cater to the soaring yet unmet demand for anti-obesity and anti-diabetic drugs, driving sales through price war won’t be easy this time. Globally the demand for weight-loss drugs, specifically the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) class of medications is “exploding"", experts told News18. The drug is used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity and it works by mimicking the effects of the body’s natural hormone, GLP-1, which helps to reduce appetite, slow digestion, boost insulin production, and decrease the amount of sugar produced by the liver. Health experts eagerly anticipate the launch of these drugs in India to meet the rising demand. It’s important to remember that India is known as the “diabetes capital of the world"", and the latest Economic Survey report reveals that the rate of adult obesity in the country has more than tripled. Popular endocrinologist Dr Anoop Misra told News18 that semaglutide and other advanced drugs in this class are “impactful, offering a range of significant health benefits"". “Their use is expected to rise sharply,"" said Misra, who is chairman of Fortis C-Doc Hospital for Diabetes and Allied Sciences. “However, cost remains a significant concern, and the availability of affordable alternatives, such as generics for Ozempic, is crucial for India where obesity and diabetes are on the rise."" As research progresses, Misra said, “We anticipate even more potent medications on the horizon that could offer substantial benefits for individuals with severe obesity."" Misra’s expectations align with the industry’s strategy—to introduce improved medicines that are more effective than current options like Ozempic but at a significantly lower cost. The Indian market for GLP-1 drugs is yet to open up fully due to the unavailability of these top brands, with affordability also being a significant barrier. It means that while Ozempic or many other top-selling versions are not in India and even if they were, they could have been unaffordable for many Indians. According to Novo Nordisk’s website, the price of an Ozempic pen (0.25 or 0.5 mg) is $968.52, which translates to over Rs 81,000. But, the local drug dealers claim to import and sell the injection for Rs 20,000 per shot. However, the market for this category may not move as it does for other generic drugs where the price of generic drugs falls dramatically. In fact, experts cautioned that moving further, the price of the copycat version of the majority of GLP-1 class drugs or semaglutide may not crash heavily. The reason is that these drugs follow a complex manufacturing process very similar to making biological products. To put it in perspective, semaglutide is a polypeptide and was originally classified as a biologic. However, under the FDA’s newly revised definition, it is no longer classified as a biologic because it contains fewer than 40 amino acids. Vishal Manchanda, pharma analyst at financial services firm Systematix, told News18 that the category registered annual sales of $50 billion this year which is almost twice the size of the Indian pharmaceutical industry. “Generally, we expect prices to crash in the range of 80 to 90% after the drug loses its patent, but in this case, we must also consider that making this class of drugs is complex. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether the desired price reduction can be achieved or not."" Currently, two innovators are dominating the $50 billion market : Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic or Wegovy (Semaglutide) and Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro/Zepbound (Tirzepatide). On Wednesday, Novo Nordisk said that it has tripled Wegovy production over the last three years and will continue to ramp up at the same pace, but still, it is unable to serve the demand. “We still have a situation where there are far more patients who would like to have the treatment than what both Eli Lilly and we can supply,"" CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told Reuters. This shows the huge demand and gap in supply. Manchanda believes that in the coming two to three years, multiple other innovator brands will emerge in the global market with eight to ten brands coming from large credible players. “This is when the economics is going to change as the demand shortages will be plugged. People in developed markets will get even better options than existing ones and developing markets like India (which are being ignored by innovators) will gain attention."" In short, it’s expected that the upcoming drugs are likely to have a better profile in terms of quicker weight loss and convenient dosage (such as oral pills instead of injections). “Hence, in a few years from now, emerging markets (including India) will have multiple GLP-1 options to choose from,"" Manchanda predicts. “Also, semaglutide generics will become available…While the price of semaglutide is expected to fall once generics are launched, it remains to be seen whether the reduction will be significant enough to greatly expand access or not."" Wegovy and Ozempic drove Novo Nordisk to record bumper sales since the launch. In fact, the success story has turned the Danish drugmaker into Europe’s most valuable firm. Estimates peg that the company’s market value of about $570 billion is more than its home country, Denmark’s, annual GDP. While Novo Nordisk declines to comment on its plan to launch Ozempic or Wegovy in India (in an email sent by News18), it’s obvious that all major Indian generic manufacturers are closely monitoring the upcoming expiry of Novo Nordisk’s exclusivity on GLP-1 drugs. Manchanda said that in India, at least five to six players are working on developing the generic versions including Sun Pharma, Biocon (which already has large-scale peptide drug-making experience), Dr Reddy’s, Zydus, Natco, Shilpa Medicare, and Aurobindo Pharma. Furthermore, Novo Nordisk may also not step back once the drug’s patent expires. The company may lower its price and continue to compete in the market. “Majority of Indian firms have capabilities to manufacture peptides and they can certainly manufacture this complex category. But we also expect the innovator Novo Nordisk to compete with generic players and chase a majority share,"" Manchanda added. On Tuesday, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories announced in an investor call that the company aims to have about “15 GLP-1 drugs"" to treat obesity and diabetes, in its portfolio with various timelines. In October, last year, the company received the nod for conducting a bioequivalence study for Ozempic (semaglutide injection) from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) after it sought a waiver of the phase-III clinical trial of the drug and its market authorisation. It aims to bring in the generic version as soon as the patent expires. A company spokesperson told News18 that while the product is under patent right now, Dr Reddy’s Labs “will definitely participate in the opportunity but we will be part of the generics entry when the patent expires"". Bengaluru-based Biocon – which is known for its expertise in developing complex biosimilars – has become the first company to win UK authorisation to offer a generic version of Novo Nordisk’s other popular GLP-1 category drug liraglutide sold under the brand name Saxenda. The firm told the Financial Times that it is ready to launch sales by November. In an interview with the Financial Times, Siddharth Mittal, chief executive officer, Biocon Limited, predicted, “When the generics come in there will be a huge price war…There is a huge demand for these drugs at the right price."" Biocon’s spokesperson did not respond to News18’s request for comment seeking more information on its plans to launch anti-obesity drugs in India. India’s top drugmaker, Sun Pharma, is working on developing the GLP-1 category drug Utreglutide. In June, it announced the results from the study showing significant weight loss, glucose-metabolic and lipid-lowering efficacy.

Heavy drinking: Semaglutide drugs linked to reduced alcohol use,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/ozempic-wegovy-curb-alcohol-cravings-heavy-drinking,"About 400 million people around the world live with alcohol use disorder (AUD) — a condition where a person is unable to stop drinking alcohol or has become dependent upon it. Also known as alcoholism, AUD has been linked to an increased risk for many diseases, including heart disease, liver disease, osteoporosis, dementia, and digestive issues. AUD is also correlated with a heightened risk for cancer. The 2024 edition of the American Association for Cancer Research’s Cancer Progress Report reported that 5.4% of all cancers are attributable to alcohol use. Traditional treatments for AUD include psychological counseling, entering a detoxification program, joining a support group like Alcoholics Anonymous, and certain medications such as disulfiram and naltrexone. Despite the availability of treatment options, past research shows that fewer than 10% of people with AUD receive any help, and only about 2% use the medications available. Now a new study recently published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry reports that semaglutide — the active ingredient in glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1) medications Ozempic and Wegovy — may help reduce alcohol cravings and frequency of heavy drinking days in people with AUD. For this study, researchers recruited 48 adults with AUD who were not actively looking for treatment. Female participants had a past-month drinking history of more than seven drinks per week, plus two or more “heavy drinking” incidents of four or more drinks at one time. Male participants had a history of drinking more than 14 drinks per week, and two or more heavy drinking episodes of five or more drinks. Study participants received either an injection of semaglutide or placebo over 9 weeks. During the study period, researchers measured the weekly drinking patterns of each participant. Upon analysis, the researchers found that participants who received semaglutide injections experienced a reduction in their weekly alcohol cravings, average drinks on drinking days, and amount of heavy drinking days, when compared to those taking the placebo. The study authors reported that in the last month of treatment, participants in the semaglutide group significantly reduced their number of heavy drinking days, and about 40% of the group detailed no heavy drinking days during that last month. Researchers also reported that the significance of semaglutide’s positive effects on several drinking outcomes was relatively greater than what is normally seen with existing AUD medications. Lastly, they found that a small subgroup of study participants treated with semaglutide and were also cigarette smokers significantly reduced their average cigarettes per day compared to those receiving the placebo. “These data suggest the potential of semaglutide and similar drugs to fill an unmet need for the treatment of alcohol use disorder,” Klara Klein, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and senior author of this study said in a press release. “Larger and longer studies in broader populations are needed to fully understand the safety and efficacy in people with alcohol use disorder, but these initial findings are promising,” she added Medical News Today had the opportunity to speak with two addiction psychiatrists from Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey about this study. Neither of them was involved in the research. Hussain M. Abdullah, MD, an addiction psychiatrist at Jersey Shore University Medical Center, told MNT he was excited to know that semaglutide went through a rigorous clinical trial as there was decent anecdotal evidence of its positive effects on treatment of alcohol use and other addictions. “There are a limited number of FDA [Food and Drug Administration-] approved medications for alcohol use disorder, having an additional treatment card on the table is an advantage,” Abdullah noted. “Alcohol use disorder is highly heterogeneous and ‘one size fits all’ is not an ideal approach to treat it. To come up with individualized treatment plans, having a range of treatment modalities is always an advantage.” Tony Issac, MD, an addiction psychiatrist at Raritan Bay Medical Center commented that this study is promising because it presents a novel pharmacological approach that may improve treatment options for individuals struggling with alcohol dependency. He explained that: “The reduction in alcohol craving and heavy/binge drinking days is particularly important as cravings are a significant factor for relapse. Having an alternative treatment option could increase accessibility and acceptance given the lower adoption rate of existing FDA approved AUD medications. Another promising aspect is semaglutide is already widely used in general medical settings which can potentially increase accessibility and further aim to reduce stigma often associated with AUD treatments.” “The study’s limitations such as small sample size, short study duration, and the fact that participants were not actively seeking treatment may suggest that the results may not fully translate to a real-world clinical setting,” he continued. “Before considering semaglutide as an off-label treatment for AUD, more research is needed to determine its long-term effectiveness, optimal dosing, and safety in patients with severe alcohol dependency,” said Isaac. MNT also spoke with representatives from three organizations for addiction treatment providers to get their reaction on this new research. “I am thrilled to see this study,” J. Greg Hobelmann, MD, MPH, co-CEO of Ashley Addiction Treatment, adjunct faculty in the Johns Hopkins Department of Psychiatry and Neurology, and secretary of the Executive Committee for the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers told MNT. “There has been a lot of hype about semaglutide (and other incretin mimetics), but we ought not base treatment on intuition and anecdotal reports.” “Although this is a small study, it was well designed and executed,” Hobelmann added. “The results are very promising. This study gives me hope and truly serves as a basis to justify further studies.” “I am always encouraged when I learn of a new tool for treating any substance use disorder, whether that is a psychosocial intervention, or a pharmaceutical,” Terrence Walton, MSW, executive director of NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals, commented to MNT. “Because there are several FDA-approved medications for alcohol use and opioid use disorders and none for methamphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorders, I was mildly disappointed that the focus was AUD. Nonetheless, I was intrigued to learn if a randomized, controlled, double-blind study would validate the anecdotal accounts I have heard regarding reductions in alcohol and drug cravings for people on weight loss medications,” he added. “I am looking forward to the next phase, which will likely include a significantly larger sample and more variation in dosage,” Walton also noted. “It is important that future studies include those with severe alcohol use disorder, including those who are treatment seeking and who may desire abstinence.” Finally, Lief Fenno, MD, PhD, chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s Council on Addiction Psychiatry and assistant professor of psychiatry at UT Austin Dell Medical School in Texas explained that: “There have been rumors that GLP1s may have an effect on alcohol consumption — we need high quality studies with direct clinical utility to know whether the rumors are true, and if so, how to use this class of medications effectively and with which patients. This study is an early step toward answering these questions. The results suggest that it is worth conducting larger and longer studies.” “Alcohol use and alcohol use disorder are common and closely associated with occupational dysfunction, relationship harm, and crime, in addition to severe medical and psychiatric consequences, including early death,” Fenno added. “I am excited about all interest and work to identify more effective ways to help patients increase their control over alcohol consumption.”","for dependent 400 400 around the 400 live with alcohol use disorderround known live for around the 400 live with alcohol use disorderlcohol use disorder (AUD) isround the 400 live with use disorder (AUD) — a About 400 million people around the world live with alcohol use disorder (AUD) — a condition around the 400 live with alcohol use disorder About 400 million people around the world live with alcohol use disorder (AUD) — a condition is for 400 for sforp drinking around the 400 live with alcohol use disorderlcohol or haround the 400 live with alcohol use disorders become dependent 400 it.

"Weight-loss jabs may help reduce alcohol intake, study finds | Alcohol | The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/12/weight-loss-jabs-may-reduce-alcohol-intake-wegovy-semaglutide,"Semaglutide, active ingredient of Wegovy and Ozempic, found to reduce cravings and cut drinking by 40% Weight-loss drugs could be used to help people reduce their intake of alcohol, researchers have said, after a study found they can cut cravings and curb heavy drinking. The medicines, originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, have revolutionised the treatment of obesity, and evidence suggests they could have benefits in other areas of health, such as reducing risk of heart attacks and strokes. Now the first clinical trial of its kind has found that semaglutide, distributed under the brand name Wegovy, cut the amount of alcohol people drank by about 40% and dramatically reduced people’s desire to drink. Researchers said the study backed up anecdotal evidence from patients and doctors that semaglutide can lead to a sudden loss of longing for alcoholic drinks. A key finding was that semaglutide’s effects were bigger than was often seen with existing drugs to curb alcoholism, even though the medicine was only administered at the lowest clinical doses. The study’s senior author Klara Klein, from the University of North Carolina school of medicine, said: “These data suggest the potential of semaglutide and similar drugs to fill an unmet need for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. “Larger and longer studies in broader populations are needed to fully understand the safety and efficacy in people with alcohol use disorder, but these initial findings are promising.” In the research, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, 48 people with drinking problems were recruited, who had not been actively seeking treatment. They all had alcohol-use disorder, which can include the inability to stop or control drinking despite negative consequences. Participants were taken to a comfortable lab setting one week before injections and asked to drink their preferred alcoholic drinks over two hours, with instructions to delay drinking if they wished. They were then randomly assigned to receive weekly, low-dose injections of semaglutide or a placebo for nine weeks, during which time their weekly drinking patterns were also measured. The semaglutide dose was 0.25mg a week for four weeks, 0.5mg a week for four weeks, and 1.0mg for one week, all given during clinic visits. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Afterwards, everyone returned to the drinking lab to repeat the process and see what had changed. Researchers calculated how much alcohol people had drunk and the alcohol concentration in their breath. Semaglutide injections reduced the amount of alcohol people drank in the lab setting, the study found, “with evidence of medium to large effect sizes for grams of alcohol consumed”. The semaglutide group also saw a 41% reduction in the number of drinks they consumed on each of their drinking days. In addition, weekly alcohol cravings dropped by about 40%, while there were also bigger reductions in heavy drinking over time compared to the placebo group. Nearly 40% of people in the semaglutide group reported no heavy drinking days in the last month of treatment, compared with 20% in the placebo group. Dr Stephen Burgess of the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, said: “This is a small study, but an exciting one. It provides evidence that semaglutide treatment can reduce alcohol consumption, similar to how it has been shown to reduce food consumption and consequently body weight. The likely mechanistic pathway is by dampening brain cues that prompt an individual to crave both food and alcohol.” Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, the chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK, welcomed the study’s findings. He said there was still an urgent need to tackle the affordability, availability and marketing of alcohol, but further research on semaglutide’s mechanism of action might also help to develop understanding of the cause of alcohol dependence.","their active by 40% Wegovy and Semaglutide, active and Ozempic, found cravings and cut Wegovy and Semaglutide, active 40% their drugs could Semaglutide, active Semaglutide, active Semaglutide, active by 40% Wegovy and Ozempic, found to and Ozempic, found cravings help people and Ozempic, found Semaglutide, active their researchers their said, after a Wegovy and Ozempic, found to reduce cravings and can cut cravings by 40% heavy found The medicines, originally developed Semaglutide, active by 40% Wegovy and Ozempic, found to and Ozempic, found cravings treat type 2 diaSemaglutide, activetes, their revolutionised the treatment of oSemaglutide, activesity, and evidence suggests they could their Semaglutide, activenefits in other areas of health, such as reducing risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Sold under brand names including Wegovy and Ozempic, semaglutide works by mimicking a gut hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), hence the technical term for it is a GLP-1 receptor agonist.

Lilly's Zepbound® (tirzepatide) superior to Wegovy® (semaglutide) in head-to-head trial showing an average weight loss of 20.2% vs. 13.7% | Eli Lilly and Company,https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-zepboundr-tirzepatide-superior-wegovyr-semaglutide-head,"Participants using Zepbound lost 50.3 lbs (22.8 kg) and participants on Wegovy lost 33.1 lbs (15.0 kg) SURMOUNT-5 compared Zepbound, a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, to Wegovy, a mono GLP-1 receptor agonist in adults living with obesity without diabetes INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced topline results from the SURMOUNT-5 phase 3b open-label randomized clinical trial. Zepbound® (tirzepatide) provided a 47% greater relative weight loss compared to Wegovy® (semaglutide). On average, Zepbound led to a superior weight loss of 20.2% compared to 13.7% with Wegovy.i At 72 weeks, Zepbound beat Wegovy on both the primary endpoint and all five key secondary endpoints in this trial of adults living with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related medical problem and without diabetes. ""Given the increased interest around obesity medications, we conducted this study to help health care providers and patients make informed decisions about treatment choice,"" said Leonard C. Glass, MD, FACE, senior vice president of global medical affairs at Lilly Cardiometabolic Health. ""We are thrilled that today's findings showed the superior weight loss of Zepbound, which helped patients achieve 47% more relative weight loss compared to Wegovy. Zepbound is in a class of its own as the only FDA-approved dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist obesity medication, and it's changing how millions of people manage this chronic disease."" In addition, in a key secondary endpoint, 31.6% of people taking Zepbound achieved at least 25% body weight loss compared to 16.1% of those taking Wegovy. The overall safety profile of Zepbound in SURMOUNT-5 was similar to previously reported SURMOUNT trials. The most commonly reported adverse events in SURMOUNT-5 for both Zepbound and Wegovy were gastrointestinal-related and were generally mild to moderate in severity. Lilly will continue to evaluate the SURMOUNT-5 results, which will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at a medical meeting next year. Tirzepatide is commercialized for adults with obesity or with overweight who also have weight-related medical problems as Zepbound in the U.S. and Mounjaro® in some global markets outside the U.S. Tirzepatide is also commercialized as Mounjaro for adults with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. Semaglutide is commercialized as Wegovy for people living with obesity or for adults with overweight who also have weight-related medical problems and Ozempic for people with type 2 diabetes. About SURMOUNT-5 SURMOUNT-5 (NCT05822830) was a multi-center, randomized, open-label, phase 3b trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Zepbound® (tirzepatide) compared with Wegovy® (semaglutide) in adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one of the following comorbidities: hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or cardiovascular disease, who did not have diabetes. The trial randomized 751 participants across the U.S. and Puerto Rico in a 1:1 ratio to receive maximum tolerated dose of Zepbound (10 mg or 15 mg) or Wegovy (1.7 mg or 2.4 mg). The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate Zepbound's superiority in percent change from baseline in body weight at 72 weeks compared to Wegovy. About tirzepatide Tirzepatide is a once-weekly dual GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) receptor and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonist. Tirzepatide is a single molecule that activates the body's receptors for GIP and GLP-1, which are natural incretin hormones. Both GIP and GLP-1 receptors are found in areas of the human brain important for appetite regulation. Tirzepatide decreases calorie intake, and the effects are likely mediated by affecting appetite. Studies of tirzepatide in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in morbidity/mortality in obesity (MMO) are ongoing. Lilly submitted data for tirzepatide in moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and obesity to the U.S. FDA and other global regulatory agencies earlier this year. Tirzepatide was approved by the U.S. FDA as Mounjaro® for adults with type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control on May 13, 2022, and as Zepbound® for adults with obesity or with excess weight and weight-related medical problems on November 8, 2023. Tirzepatide is also commercialized as Mounjaro in some global markets outside the U.S. for adults with obesity or those who are overweight who also have a weight-related comorbid condition. Tirzepatide is the first and only approved dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term. Both Mounjaro and Zepbound should be used in combination with diet and exercise. INDICATION AND SAFETY SUMMARY WITH WARNINGS Zepbound® (ZEHP-bownd) is an injectable prescription medicine that may help adults with obesity, or some adults with overweight who also have weight-related medical problems to lose excess body weight and keep the weight off.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements (as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) about Zepbound® (tirzepatide) as a treatment for adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one comorbidity, who do not have diabetes and reflects Lilly's current beliefs and expectations. However, as with any pharmaceutical product, there are substantial risks and uncertainties in the process of drug research, development, and commercialization. Among other things, there is no guarantee that future study results will be consistent with study results to date, that Zepbound will receive additional regulatory approvals, or that Lilly will execute its strategy as expected. For further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from Lilly's expectations, see Lilly's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
